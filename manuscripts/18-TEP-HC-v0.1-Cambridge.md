## Abstract


General Relativity is extensively validated in the deeply screened, dense regime of the Solar System, but cosmological tensions—specifically the Hubble discrepancy and galactic mass anomalies—motivate testing a scale-dependent breakdown of the isochrony axiom.



The Temporal Equivalence Principle (TEP) addresses these late-universe anomalies via a dynamical proper-time field, governed by environment-dependent Gradient Screening with saturation scale $\rho_T \approx 20$ g/cm³ (Paper 0, §7). Previous analytical approximations and CAMB integrations suggest this scalar field is frozen during radiation domination ($T^\mu_\mu \approx 0$). Full integration into linear structure formation requires a native Horndeski evaluation.



This paper maps the TEP bi-metric framework—defined by a conformal factor $A(\phi)$ and a disformal deformation $B(\phi)$—onto the Bellini-Sawicki Effective Field Theory (EFT) of Dark Energy to provide the theoretical blueprint for full linear structure mapping. To isolate the fundamental TEP effect and avoid Horndeski-class instabilities, the current numerical analysis isolates the background-only realization as the baseline numerical implementation.



This paper implements the native TEP background-only modification directly in hi_class via the transition function `f_T(z) = ln(1+z) * exp(-(z/z_T)^n_T)`, applied through the Jordan-frame conformal factor `M(z) = A/(1-alpha_A)` as `H_TEP(z) = H_LCDM(z) * M(z)` while preserving standard General Relativistic perturbations. The functional form is the shared TEP-C0 implementation (Paper 26): the `exp(-(z/z_T)^n_T)` factor enforces early-time freezing, so the temporal-shear field is suppressed for `z >> z_T`. Direct Boltzmann integration verifies this phenomenological boundary condition, confirming that the code preserves the pre-recombination sound horizon to parts-per-million (`r_s^TEP / r_s^LCDM = 0.999994`) and leaves the acoustic-peak morphology untouched. A direct exact-frame-factor check confirms that replacing the implemented first-order factor `A/(1-alpha_A)` with the exact form `A(1+alpha_A)` leaves `r_s` unchanged to quoted precision in the screened regime (Section 5.4 and Appendix A.3a). The only CMB-level effect of a non-zero `epsilon_T` is a late-time angular-diameter-distance projection that rigidly rescales the angular acoustic scale `theta_s` (a +0.185% shift at the fiducial `epsilon_T = 0.0066`, `z_T = 5`, `n_T = 2`) and is largely degenerate with `H_0`.



A joint hi_class Cobaya MCMC (Planck 2018 low-$\ell$ TT/EE + lensing + BAO + Pantheon+) yields `epsilon_T = 0.0056 +/- 0.0043` and `H_0 = 66.63 +/- 1.70` km/s/Mpc; TEP-C0 (Paper 26) with full Planck TTTEEE drives the homogeneous amplitude to `epsilon_T = (6.75 +/- 0.24) \times 10^{-6}`. Pantheon+ nested sampling in TEP-C0 gives strong Bayesian preference for the TEP geometry (Bayes factor 131.6 vs $\Lambda$CDM for $z_T = 5$). Within the TEP framework, the Hubble tension is thereby reinterpreted as a late-time, environment-dependent clock-transport effect (Paper 11) rather than through a modified homogeneous expansion history at recombination.

## 1. Introduction


### 1.1 Contextualizing the TEP Corpus


The Temporal Equivalence Principle (TEP) has been constrained across many orders of magnitude in mass density, from terrestrial laboratory scales ($\rho \sim 20$ g/cm³) to the cosmological mean ($\rho \sim 10^{-29}$ g/cm³). Previous papers in this series have established:



- *Terrestrial scales (Paper 1):* Terrestrial atomic clock networks show 4,200 km phase correlations consistent with the 20 g/cm³ screening threshold.

- *Galactic scales (Paper 6, UCD):* SPARC rotation curves validate the potential-dependent proper-time mapping.

- *Stellar scales (Paper 13, WB):* Gaia DR3 wide binaries exhibit the predicted environment-dependent kinematic transition.

- *Cosmological scales (Paper 12, JWST):* High-redshift anomalies align with environment-dependent time dilation.




### 1.2 The Two-Ended Hubble Tension


The Hubble tension represents one of the most persistent challenges in modern cosmology. Cepheid-calibrated local distance ladder measurements yield $H_0 \approx 73$ km/s/Mpc, while early-universe CMB inference from Planck 2018 gives $H_0 = 67.36 \pm 0.54$ km/s/Mpc—a discrepancy of approximately 4.8$\sigma$.


Previous TEP work (Paper 11, H₀) demonstrated that the Cepheid environmental bias—operating in the unscreened stellar atmospheres where Cepheids pulsate—naturally raises the local measurement. However, a complete resolution requires demonstrating that this mechanism does *not* disturb the early-universe inference at the surface of last scattering ($z \approx 1089$).


### 1.3 Purpose of This Paper


To move beyond the quasi-static approximations of previous work by natively solving the TEP-modified background expansion $H(z)$ in hi_class while preserving standard GR perturbations, thereby performing a clean acoustic-scale test of the homogeneous temporal background. This requires:



- A mapping of TEP's bi-metric structure onto the Bellini-Sawicki EFT formalism, providing the theoretical blueprint for full linear structure mapping, while establishing the background-only realization as the baseline numerical implementation.

- Native implementation in hi_class of the TEP background transition function and Jordan-frame Hubble modifier.

- ΛCDM baseline MCMC parameter estimation ($H_0$, $\Omega_b h^2$, $\Omega_{\rm cdm} h^2$, $n_s$, $A_s$, $\tau$, $A_{\rm planck}$) against Planck 2018, BAO, and Pantheon+ data to establish the constraints that TEP should satisfy.



The critical question: Can TEP preserve CMB acoustic peaks while permitting late-time $H_0$ variation?

## 2. Theoretical Architecture: The EFT Mapping

### 2.1 The Bi-Metric Action

The TEP framework posits that matter couples to a screened metric $\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}$ related to the Einstein-frame metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ via a disformal transformation:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:3_theory_01}
\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu} = A^2(\phi) g_{\mu\nu} + B(\phi) \nabla_\mu\phi \nabla_\nu\phi
\end{equation}

where:

- $A(\phi) = \exp(\beta_A\phi/M_{\rm Pl})$ is the conformal factor, with $\beta_A = -1.0$ (the locked lab-scale convention used across the TEP corpus)

- $B(\phi)$ controls disformal deformation of the causal structure

- $\phi$ is the dynamical proper-time field

*Metric signature convention:* $(+, -, -, -)$ throughout.

### 2.2 Formal Bellini-Sawicki Alpha Correspondence

hi_class requires the EFT property functions $\alpha_i$ that encode metric modifications at linear perturbation level.

#### 2.2.1 Planck Mass Running ($\alpha_M$)

The conformal coupling directly determines the running of the effective Planck mass:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:3_theory_02}
\alpha_M \equiv \frac{d \ln M_{\rm eff}^2}{d \ln a} = \frac{d \ln A^2(\phi)}{d \ln a} = \frac{2\beta_A}{M_{\rm Pl}} \frac{\phi'}{\mathcal{H}}
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{H} = aH$ is the conformal Hubble parameter and primes denote derivatives with respect to conformal time.

#### 2.2.2 Tensor Speed Excess ($\alpha_T$)

The disformal term $B(\phi)$ alters the gravitational wave propagation speed. Multi-messenger constraints from GW170817/GRB 170817A require:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:3_theory_03}
|c_g - c_\gamma|/c \lesssim 10^{-15} \Rightarrow \alpha_T \approx 0 \text{ (today)}
\end{equation}

However, $B(\phi)$ may be non-zero at recombination ($z \approx 1100$) provided it relaxes to zero by $z \sim 0$.

#### 2.2.3 Braiding ($\alpha_B$) and Kineticity ($\alpha_K$)

These functions govern scalar field clustering and metric mixing:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:3_theory_04}
\alpha_B = -\frac{\mathcal{H}'\phi'}{\mathcal{H}^2} \cdot f_B(\phi, X)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:3_theory_05}
\alpha_K = \frac{\phi'^2}{\mathcal{H}^2 M_{\rm Pl}^2} \cdot f_K(\phi, X)
\end{equation}

where $X = -\nabla_\mu\phi \nabla^\mu\phi/2$ and $f_B$, $f_K$ are functions derived from the TEP action:

- $f_B(\phi, X)$ encodes the disformal coupling to the energy-momentum tensor trace.

- $f_K(\phi, X)$ encodes the kinetic term non-canonicality from the TEP proper-time field.

The explicit functional forms follow from the bi-metric action (Equation \ref{eq:3_theory_01}) and are determined by the conformal factor $A(\phi)$ and the disformal function $B(\phi)$. Their derivation is detailed in the TEP theoretical framework (Papers 1 and 11 of the TEP corpus).

Because the production analysis in this paper does not activate the scalar perturbation sector, the $\alpha_B$ and $\alpha_K$ expressions are used as formal EFT bookkeeping rather than as fitted numerical functions; a full perturbative TEP-hi_class treatment would require explicit closure of $f_B(\phi,X)$, $f_K(\phi,X)$, sound-speed, and no-ghost stability conditions.

### 2.3 The Radiation Domination Freezing Mechanism

During radiation domination, the trace of the energy-momentum tensor vanishes:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:3_theory_06}
T^\mu_\mu = -\rho + 3p \approx 0 \text{ (radiation)}
\end{equation}

Since the TEP scalar field couples to $T^\mu_\mu$, the source term for $\phi$ evolution is suppressed. The field freezes at its initial value, and $\alpha_M, \alpha_B \rightarrow 0$. This ensures:

- Primary acoustic peaks ($100 \lesssim \ell \lesssim 2000$) generated at $z \sim 1089$ remain unmodified

- The sound horizon $r_s$ is preserved, anchoring $H_0$ from CMB at $\sim 67$ km/s/Mpc (Planck 2018: $67.36 \pm 0.54$ km/s/Mpc)

- Late-time matter domination reactivates the scalar field, enabling environmental $H_0$ variations

*Archived EFT reference.* The Bellini–Sawicki $\alpha_i$ functions mapped from the TEP bi-metric action (step-3 fiducial) are archived in `results/03_alpha_functions.json`. Production CMB constraints use the native background-only `tep_mode` implementation (Section 4), not this linear-perturbation mapping.


## 3. Software Implementation: hi_class and the Unscreened Regime


### 3.1 The hi_class Architecture


hi_class extends the CLASS Boltzmann solver to handle general scalar-tensor theories via the EFT formalism. This work uses hi_class v3.2.3 with the modified gravity (SMG) module enabled.


### 3.2 Native TEP Background-Only Implementation

The native TEP background-only Hubble modification is implemented directly in hi_class via the `tep_mode` flag. When enabled, the background expansion history is modified as:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:4_implementation_01}
H_{\rm TEP}(z) = H_{\Lambda\rm CDM}(z) \times M(z), \quad M(z) = \frac{A(z)}{1 - \alpha_A(z)}
\end{equation}

where $S(z) = \exp[-(z/z_T)^{n_T}]$ is the redshift suppression factor, $A(z) = \exp[\epsilon_T \ln(1+z)\,S(z)]$ is the covariant conformal factor, and $\alpha_A = -d\ln A/d\ln(1+z)$. The first-order form $M = A/(1-\alpha_A)$ is directly checked against the exact frame factor $M_{\rm exact}=A(1+\alpha_A)$ in Section 5.4 and Appendix A.3a. The transition function $f_T(z) = \ln(1+z)\,S(z)$ appearing in the exponent is the shared TEP-C0 implementation (Paper 26; `core/cosmology.py`: `f_T`, `conformal_factor_native`, `jordan_frame_M`):

\begin{equation} \label{eq:4_implementation_01b}
f_T(z) = \ln(1+z)\,S(z).
\end{equation}

The suppression factor $S(z)$ drives $f_T \to 0$ for $z \gg z_T$ well before recombination, so the homogeneous expansion at last scattering is unmodified (radiation-domination freezing, Section 2.3); the $\ln(1+z)$ factor enforces $f_T(0)=0$, fixing the local reference frame so $H_0$ is unchanged. The function peaks at intermediate redshift ($z \sim z_T$) and vanishes at both ends.

*Implementation note:* an earlier development build used the *complement* $f_T = 1 - \exp[-(z/z_T)^{n_T}]$, which instead saturates to unity for $z \gg z_T$ and applied the full modification *at* recombination -- inverting the freezing mechanism and corrupting the acoustic peaks. That bug has been corrected (see Appendix A.3). The default TEP parameters are:



```
tep_mode = yes
epsilon_T = 0.0066
z_T = 5.0
n_T = 2.0
```

Standard General Relativistic perturbations are preserved; the modification affects only the homogeneous background expansion. This implementation is the hi_class analogue of the CLASS native TEP module used in TEP-C0 (Paper 26).


### 3.3 Perturbation Stability

Since the native TEP implementation modifies only $H(z)$ and leaves perturbations unchanged, no modified-gravity stability constraints arise. The perturbation equations reduce to standard GR with the effective background scale factor rescaled by the TEP Hubble modification. This is a significant advantage over Horndeski parametrizations, which require careful treatment of scalar sound speeds, ghost instabilities, and gradient instabilities.


### 3.4 Pipeline Architecture

The full analysis pipeline, executed via `scripts/run_all.py`, consists of:


- *Step 0 (Setup):* Environment configuration and dependency check.

- *Step 1 (Install):* Install Cobaya, Planck 2018 likelihoods, and hi_class with the native TEP patch (`external/patches/hiclass_tep_native.patch`).

- *Step 2 (Background):* Compute the TEP-modified background expansion history $H(z)$ and density evolution.

- *Step 3 (Alpha Functions):* Compute Bellini-Sawicki coefficients from the TEP theoretical mapping (archived for reference).

- *Step 4 (CMB Spectra):* Run hi_class with native `tep_mode` at the Planck 2018 best-fit point. Compare TT, TE, and EE spectra against standard CLASS $\Lambda$CDM.

- *Step 5 (Jordan-Frame Scan):* Dual-scan reconstruction of the acoustic scale in screened and unscreened limits.

- *Step 6 (Cobaya Config):* Generate the Cobaya YAML configuration for the MCMC pipeline with native TEP parameters.

- *Step 7 (MCMC):* Execute the Cobaya MCMC with hi_class, using real Planck + BAO + Pantheon+ likelihoods.

- *Step 8 (Posteriors):* Analyze MCMC chains with burn-in removal and weighted statistics.

- *Step 9 (Synthesis):* Combine all results into summary JSON and markdown.


Publication figures are generated separately via `python scripts/generate_figures.py` (not part of `run_all.py`). Both figures are written to `results/figures/`. Figure 2 requires step 04b. Include them in the static site with `cd site && npm run build`. Note: internal pipeline filenames (`figure_4_H0_comparison.png`, `figure_5_jordan_theta_s.png`) differ from publication figure numbering (Figure 1, Figure 2).

## 4. MCMC Parameter Estimation Pipeline

### 4.1 The Cobaya Framework

Cobaya provides a Python interface to CLASS/hi_class with extensive MCMC sampling capabilities. The transition from SciPy/Pandas pipelines to Cobaya enables:

- Native hi_class integration without file-based I/O bottlenecks

- Parallel tempering and adaptive Metropolis-Hastings sampling

- Direct Planck likelihood wrapper integration

- Seamless GetDist posterior visualization

### 4.2 Likelihood Configuration

The pipeline uses the following Planck 2018 likelihoods:

| Likelihood | Description | $\ell$ Range |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `planck_2018_lowl.TT` | Low-$\ell$ temperature | 2–29 |
| `planck_2018_lowl.EE` | Low-$\ell$ polarization | 2–29 |
| `planck_2018_lensing.native` | CMB lensing reconstruction | 8–400 |
| `bao.sdss_dr12_consensus_final` | BAO SDSS DR12 consensus | — |
| `sn.pantheonplus` | Type Ia supernovae (Pantheon+) | — |

### 4.3 Free Parameters and Priors

The MCMC pipeline samples standard $\Lambda$CDM parameters alongside the TEP amplitude parameter $\epsilon_T$:

| Parameter | Prior | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $\Omega_b h^2$ | $\mathcal{U}(0.005, 0.1)$ | Baryon density |
| $\Omega_{\rm cdm} h^2$ | $\mathcal{U}(0.01, 0.99)$ | Cold dark matter density |
| $H_0$ | $\mathcal{U}(40, 100)$ | Hubble constant |
| $\tau$ | $\mathcal{U}(0.01, 0.8)$ | Optical depth |
| $A_s$ | $\mathcal{U}(10^{-10}, 5 \times 10^{-9})$ | Scalar amplitude |
| $n_s$ | $\mathcal{U}(0.94, 1.0)$ | Scalar spectral index |
| $A_{\rm planck}$ | $\mathcal{U}(0.9, 1.1)$ | Planck calibration nuisance |
| $\epsilon_T$ | $\mathcal{U}(-1, 1)$ | TEP amplitude parameter (background Hubble modification) |

The hi_class configuration uses native `tep_mode` with the corrected transition function $f_T(z)=\ln(1+z)\exp[-(z/z_T)^{n_T}]$ and fixed `z_T = 5.0`, `n_T = 2.0`, with `epsilon_T` sampled freely in `params`. This modifies only the background Hubble expansion while preserving standard GR perturbations. The production configuration is `data/cobaya/tep_hiclass_suite.yaml` (reference alternate: `data/cobaya/tep_native_mcmc.yaml`).

*Pipeline status.* The native-`tep_mode` joint MCMC against Planck 2018 low-$\ell$ TT/EE + lensing + BAO (SDSS DR12) + Pantheon+ was run using the structurally corrected hi_class engine, allowing $\Omega_\Lambda$ to natively fill the background cosmological budget. The primary production chain (`tep_hiclass_suite`; 19,033 post-burn-in samples from a single chain; Gelman–Rubin $R-1$ is undefined for one chain, and the sampler-internal $R-1$ reported by Cobaya reached $0.045$ at termination) gives a $\Lambda$CDM-compatible background while measuring the TEP amplitude parameter:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:5_mcmc_epsT}
\epsilon_T = 0.0056 \pm 0.0043,
\end{equation}

with $H_0 = 66.63 \pm 1.70$ km/s/Mpc, $\Omega_b h^2 = 0.0212 \pm 0.0025$, $\Omega_{\rm cdm} h^2 = 0.1154 \pm 0.0042$, $\tau = 0.049 \pm 0.007$, $A_{\rm planck} = 1.088 \pm 0.012$, and $S_8 = 0.870 \pm 0.028$. The result is consistent with the TEP dual-domain expectation: the homogeneous amplitude $\epsilon_T$ remains small ($\sim 10^{-3}$) on the largest scales, where the CMB bound from TEP-C0 (Paper 26) is much tighter.

The low-$\ell$+lensing+BAO+Pantheon+ runs therefore serve as implementation and robustness tests of the native hi_class module, while the high-$\ell$ TTTEEE likelihoods in TEP-C0 provide the decisive homogeneous-amplitude bound.

*Multi-chain validation.* A parallel 4-chain run (`tep_native`; configuration `data/cobaya/tep_native_mcmc.yaml`) using a Gaussian $A_{\rm planck}$ prior (loc = 1.0, scale = 0.0025) produced 2,993 post-burn-in samples with maximum Gelman–Rubin $R-1 = 0.098$ ($R-1$ for $\epsilon_T = 0.098$; all other parameters $R-1 < 0.05$). This yields $\epsilon_T = 0.0044 \pm 0.0040$ and $H_0 = 66.89 \pm 1.35$ km/s/Mpc, consistent with the primary chain at $0.21\sigma$ and $0.12\sigma$ respectively. While this consistency run reaches $R-1 = 0.098$ on $\epsilon_T$, the widened-prior chain below provides a fully converged multi-chain determination ($\epsilon_T$ $R-1 = 0.013$, all parameters $R-1 < 0.05$), and the two agree to $0.06\sigma$. Together they confirm the single-chain result is not an artefact of the sampling configuration.

*Planck calibration prior sensitivity.* The nuisance parameter $A_{\rm planck}$ (absolute CMB calibration) is implemented as a hard uniform prior on $[0.9, 1.1]$ in the primary chain. The posterior mean is $A_{\rm planck} = 1.088 \pm 0.012$ with maximum sampled value $1.1000$, indicating saturation against the upper prior bound. To test whether this truncation biases the cosmological inference, we ran a dedicated 4-chain sensitivity test with the prior widened to $[0.9, 1.25]$ (configuration `data/cobaya/tep_hiclass_aplanck_sens.yaml`). The converged run (1,640 total samples; all parameters Gelman–Rubin $R-1 < 0.05$; maximum $R-1 = 0.044$ for $\Omega_{\rm cdm} h^2$) yields $A_{\rm planck} = 1.223 \pm 0.044$, confirming the old posterior was truncated by approximately $3.0\sigma$. The TEP amplitude from the widened run is $\epsilon_T = 0.0047 \pm 0.0040$ ($R-1 = 0.013$), consistent with the primary chain at $0.15\sigma$ and with the multi-chain validation at $0.06\sigma$. The correlation between $A_{\rm planck}$ and $\epsilon_T$ is $r = -0.19$, and splitting at $A_{\rm planck} = 1.15$ gives a difference in $\epsilon_T$ of only $-0.21\sigma$. Even a $0.1$ upward shift in $A_{\rm planck}$ would move $H_0$ by only $\sim 0.2$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, well below its posterior width. The $\chi^2$ does decrease monotonically toward the old boundary, but there is no evidence of a degeneracy cascade with $\epsilon_T$. The TEP constraint on the homogeneous amplitude is robust against $A_{\rm planck}$ prior systematics.

The companion paper TEP-C0 (Paper 26) provides the primary late-time and full-Planck constraints: Pantheon+ nested sampling gives Bayes factor 131.6 vs $\Lambda$CDM for TEP M1 ($z_T=5$), and joint MCMC with full Planck TTTEEE drives the homogeneous shear amplitude to $\epsilon_T = (6.75 \pm 0.24) \times 10^{-6}$.

## 5. Results and Cosmological Constraints

### 5.1 The Acoustic Spectra

The physically meaningful test of the native TEP background modification is not the raw size of the $C_\ell$ residual but *where* the modification acts. Because $f_T(z) = \ln(1+z)\exp[-(z/z_T)^{n_T}]$ is frozen to zero for $z \gg z_T$, the recombination-era physics is left intact, as verified directly from the hi_class background tables.

#### 5.1.1 Sound-horizon and acoustic-peak preservation

Running hi_class native `tep_mode` against standard CLASS $\Lambda$CDM at the Planck 2018 best-fit point, with $\epsilon_T = 0.0066$, $z_T = 5$, $n_T = 2$, yields:

- *Sound horizon preserved to ~6 ppm:* $r_s^{\rm TEP}/r_s^{\Lambda\rm CDM} = 0.999994$. The comoving sound horizon at last scattering integrates over $z > z_*$, where $f_T \to 0$; the TEP modification is invisible to it. This is the direct demonstration of the radiation-domination freezing mechanism.

- *Acoustic-peak morphology unchanged:* with $r_s$, the baryon loading, and the photon-baryon driving at $z \approx 1089$ all unmodified, the relative peak heights and the damping tail are identical to $\Lambda$CDM.

#### 5.1.2 The residual is a late-time projection, largely degenerate with $H_0$

The modification *is* active over intermediate redshift ($z \sim 1$–$15$, peaking near $z_T$), so it changes the comoving distance to last scattering. At the fiducial $\epsilon_T = 0.0066$ this shifts the angular acoustic scale by $\Delta\theta_s/\theta_s = +0.185\%$ ($D_C^{\rm TEP}/D_C^{\Lambda\rm CDM} = 0.9981$, with $r_s$ fixed). This rigid rescaling produces a coherent, oscillatory $\Delta C_\ell/C_\ell$ pattern whose envelope reaches $\sim 1.8\%$ across $100 < \ell < 2000$ at $\epsilon_T = 0.0066$ and scales linearly with $\epsilon_T$ (e.g. $\sim 0.3\%$ at $\epsilon_T = 0.001$). This is *not* a change in acoustic-peak physics: it is a pure angular-diameter-distance projection, largely degenerate with $H_0$. In a parameter fit the standard parameters absorb it via a small $H_0$ shift, so the CMB does not exclude TEP -- it bounds the *homogeneous* amplitude $\epsilon_T$ to be small (Section 5.2).

#### 5.1.3 Polarization Spectra ($C_\ell^{TE}, C_\ell^{EE}$)

The TE and EE spectra inherit the same behaviour: the recombination-era polarization source is unmodified (since $f_T \to 0$ there), and the only effect is the common $\theta_s$ projection shared with TT.

### 5.2 Cosmological Constraints: Late-Time Evidence and the CMB Bound

The cosmological constraints on TEP come from two complementary regimes, established in the companion paper TEP-C0 (Paper 26).

*Late-time evidence (supernovae).* A nested-sampling model comparison over the full $1701\times1701$ Pantheon+ statistical-plus-systematic covariance finds substantial Bayesian preference for the TEP geometry over $\Lambda$CDM:

| Model | Bayes factor vs $\Lambda$CDM | Interpretation |

| Pure shear (tired light) | $5.1\times10^{-10}$ | Rejected (sanity check) |

On the Bayesian Information Criterion (which penalizes the flexible $w$CDM/CPL prior volumes), TEP M1 ($z_T = 5$) is the global optimum (TEP-C0, Paper 26). The decisive rejection of pure tired-light confirms that genuine metric expansion is present; TEP reinterprets only the *acceleration* as accumulated temporal shear.

*Homogeneous (CMB) bound.* As shown in Section 5.1, a non-zero homogeneous $\epsilon_T$ acts on the CMB only through the $\theta_s$ projection, which is largely degenerate with $H_0$. The low-$\ell$ Planck likelihoods used in this paper's hi_class MCMC (TT/EE + lensing, without high-$\ell$ Plik) yield $\epsilon_T = 0.0056 \pm 0.0043$, consistent with zero at $\sim 1.3\sigma$, while $H_0$, $\Omega_b h^2$, $\Omega_{\rm cdm} h^2$, $A_s$ and $\tau$ remain Planck-compatible. The primary homogeneous bound comes from TEP-C0 (Paper 26): joint MCMC with full Planck TTTEEE drives $\epsilon_T = (6.75 \pm 0.24) \times 10^{-6}$. The scalar spectral index $n_s$ is only weakly constrained in this run ($n_s = 0.996 \pm 0.004$); the high-$\ell$ bound $n_s = 0.9619 \pm 0.0046$ comes from the same TEP-C0 joint analysis.

The low-$\ell$+lensing+BAO+Pantheon+ runs therefore serve as implementation and robustness tests of the native hi_class module, while the high-$\ell$ TTTEEE likelihoods in TEP-C0 provide the decisive homogeneous-amplitude bound.

*Native-TEP joint MCMC.* This paper's contribution is the verified hi_class implementation, the demonstration of $r_s$ preservation (Section 5.1), and a joint Cobaya MCMC using hi_class native `tep_mode` against Planck 2018 low-$\ell$ TT/EE + lensing + BAO (SDSS DR12) + Pantheon+ (standard GR perturbations; configuration in `data/cobaya/tep_hiclass_suite.yaml`, output chain `results/mcmc_chains/tep_hiclass_suite`). The primary chain (19,033 post-burn-in samples; single-chain; Gelman–Rubin is undefined for a single chain, sampler-internal $R-1 = 0.045$ at termination) gives a $\Lambda$CDM-compatible background: $H_0 = 66.63 \pm 1.70$, $\Omega_b h^2 = 0.0212 \pm 0.0025$, $\Omega_{\rm cdm} h^2 = 0.1154 \pm 0.0042$, $\tau = 0.049 \pm 0.007$, $S_8 = 0.870 \pm 0.028$, with $\epsilon_T = 0.0056 \pm 0.0043$ and $A_{\rm planck} = 1.088 \pm 0.012$. A parallel 4-chain run (`tep_native`) with maximum $R-1 = 0.098$ yields $\epsilon_T = 0.0044 \pm 0.0040$ and $H_0 = 66.89 \pm 1.35$, consistent with the primary chain at $0.21\sigma$. A dedicated sensitivity test with the $A_{\rm planck}$ prior widened to $[0.9, 1.25]$ converged with all parameters Gelman–Rubin $R-1 < 0.05$ (1,640 total samples), giving $\epsilon_T = 0.0047 \pm 0.0040$ and $A_{\rm planck} = 1.223 \pm 0.044$; the TEP amplitude is consistent with the primary chain at $0.15\sigma$ and with the multi-chain validation at $0.06\sigma$. This is consistent with the Dual-Domain expectation: macroscopic temporal shear remains $\sim 10^{-3}$ on homogeneous scales while late-time kinematic data prefer larger effective amplitudes in void environments (TEP-C0, Paper 26).

### 5.3 The Hubble Tension in TEP


The two regimes above reconcile the Hubble tension without modifying the recombination-era expansion. The homogeneous background is $\Lambda$CDM-compatible ($\epsilon_T \approx 0$ on homogeneous scales, $H_0 \approx 67$ km/s/Mpc from the CMB), while the apparent local $H_0 \approx 73$ km/s/Mpc arises from environment-dependent clock-transport bias along the local distance ladder (Cepheid/SN Ia calibration in unscreened stellar atmospheres). Removing this bias shifts the SH0ES value to $H_0 \approx 69$ km/s/Mpc (Paper 11), bridging the gap to the CMB background. The tension is thus a measurement-environment effect, not a modified homogeneous expansion history.

*Figure 1.* $H_0$ in the TEP picture. Planck 2018 CMB and this paper's hi_class joint MCMC ($H_0 = 66.63 \pm 1.70$ km/s/Mpc) define the homogeneous background; the local SH0ES value ($73.0$ km/s/Mpc) is reinterpreted as clock-transport bias, shifting to $\approx 69$ km/s/Mpc when corrected (Paper 11).

### 5.4 The Jordan Frame and the No-Dark-Energy Reconstruction

While the joint MCMC successfully validates the large-scale compatibility of the conformal-sector amplitude $\epsilon_T$ alongside $\Omega_\Lambda$, the physical implementation of TEP in the Boltzmann code operates in the Jordan frame. The code evaluates the standard $\Lambda$CDM Hubble rate $H_{\Lambda\rm CDM}(z)$ on the physical (Jordan-frame) redshift grid and multiplies it by the conformal-frame geometric factor $M(z) = A(\phi)/(1-\alpha_A)$, giving the Jordan-frame expansion rate:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:6_results_02}
H_{\rm TEP}(z) = H_{\Lambda\rm CDM}(z) \times M(z), \qquad M(z) = \frac{A(\phi)}{1-\alpha_A}.
\end{equation}

The conformal factor $A(\phi) = \exp[\epsilon_T \ln(1+z)\,S(z)]$ and the coupling $\alpha_A = -d\ln A/d\ln(1+z)$ are both evaluated at the physical (Jordan-frame) redshift $z$ (the code's native variable). The implementation evaluates $\alpha_A(z)$ locally at each integration step to account for its redshift dependence through the transition function. There are no arbitrary fudge factors: the microphysics of recombination and the visibility function are untouched. The factor $M(z)=A/(1-\alpha_A)$ used in the present code is first-order equivalent to the exact frame-transform result $M_{\rm exact}=A(1+\alpha_A)$. In the screened CMB regime the discrepancy enters only at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_A^2)$; Appendix A.3a quantifies this difference. A direct background-only verification scan (step 04c) confirms that the exact factor $M_{\rm exact}$ gives an identical sound horizon $r_s$ (0.0 ppm) and a $\theta_s$ projection differing by $<0.01\%$ at the fiducial $\epsilon_T=0.0066$, consistent with the expected $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_A^2)$ scaling. By computing standard $H_{\Lambda\rm CDM}$ and multiplying by $M(z)$, the Boltzmann code integrates the modified background consistently with the TEP framework. In the production code, $z$ denotes the physical redshift variable used by the Boltzmann background module; Appendix A.3a distinguishes $z_E$ and $\tilde z$ only to derive the frame relation, after which the screened-regime implementation is evaluated on the code's physical redshift grid.

To explicitly map the action of the conformal field on the acoustic horizon independent of $\Omega_\Lambda$, the acoustic scale is evaluated in a mathematically idealized flat matter-only geometry ($\Omega_m = 1.0$, $\Omega_\Lambda = 0.0$) under two regimes using the hi_class native `tep_mode` implementation with the exact covariant conformal factor $A(z) = \exp(\epsilon_T f_T(z))$ and the full Jordan-frame factor $M(z) = A/(1-\alpha_A)$.

#### Regime I: Standard model ($z_T = 5$, early-universe suppression active)

In the standard TEP model, the suppression $\exp[-(z/z_T)^{n_T}]$ forces $S(z) \to 0$ for $z \gg z_T$, protecting recombination-era physics. The scan confirms this design intent:

| $\epsilon_T$ | $100\theta_s$ | $r_s$ [Mpc] | $\Delta D_C / D_C$ | Interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $0.00$ | $1.0403$ | $144.526$ | $0.00\%$ | Pure EdS reference (no TEP) |
| $0.01$ | $1.0432$ | $144.524$ | $-0.28\%$ | $r_s$ preserved; $\theta_s$ shifts from $D_C$ |
| $0.02$ | $1.0461$ | $144.523$ | $-0.56\%$ | $r_s$ preserved; $\theta_s$ shifts from $D_C$ |
| $0.03$ | $1.0490$ | $144.522$ | $-0.84\%$ | $r_s$ preserved; $\theta_s$ shifts from $D_C$ |
| $0.04$ | $1.0519$ | $144.520$ | $-1.11\%$ | $r_s$ preserved; $\theta_s$ shifts from $D_C$ |
| $0.05$ | $1.0548$ | $144.519$ | $-1.38\%$ | $r_s$ preserved; $\theta_s$ shifts from $D_C$ |
| $0.06$ | $1.0577$ | $144.518$ | $-1.65\%$ | $r_s$ preserved; $\theta_s$ shifts from $D_C$ |

The recombination-era expansion rate is overwhelmingly protected by the exponential suppression $\exp[-(z/z_T)^{n_T}]$, leaving $r_s$ effectively untouched. With the restored sign convention ($H_{\rm TEP} = H_{\Lambda\rm CDM} \times M$), the intermediate-redshift Hubble modification ($z \sim 1$--$15$) *increases* the effective expansion rate, decreasing the comoving distance $D_C$ to last scattering and thereby *increasing* $\theta_s = r_s/D_C$. This is the freezing mechanism in action: the early universe is protected, and the TEP effect acts only where the suppression is non-negligible. The sound horizon $r_s$ changes by less than $0.006\%$ across the scan, confirming that the recombination-era expansion rate is overwhelmingly protected. The $+0.28\%$-per-$0.01$ $\theta_s$ slope in this EdS scan is mutually consistent with the $+0.185\%$ shift at $\epsilon_T = 0.0066$ reported in Section 5.1.2 for the full $\Lambda$CDM case, confirming that the angular-diameter-distance projection scales linearly with $\epsilon_T$ across different background geometries.

#### Regime II: Unscreened limit ($z_T \to \infty$, no early-universe suppression)

In the theoretical boundary where screening is disabled ($z_T \to \infty$), the conformal factor $A(z) = \exp(\epsilon_T \ln(1+z)) = (1+z)^{\epsilon_T}$ grows as a power law at all redshifts. The Jordan-frame factor $M(z) = A/(1-\alpha_A)$ then modifies the Hubble rate aggressively at $z \sim 1100$, *accelerating* the physical expansion during recombination and dynamically *squeezing* the sound horizon:

| $\epsilon_T$ | $100\theta_s$ | $r_s$ [Mpc] | $\Delta D_C / D_C$ | Interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $0.00$ | $1.0403$ | $144.526$ | $0.00\%$ | Pure EdS reference (no TEP) |
| $0.01$ | $0.9763$ | $134.412$ | $-0.90\%$ | $r_s$ squeezed by temporal acceleration |
| $0.02$ | $0.9161$ | $125.009$ | $-1.78\%$ | $r_s$ squeezed by temporal acceleration |
| $0.03$ | $0.8596$ | $116.267$ | $-2.64\%$ | $r_s$ squeezed by temporal acceleration |
| $0.04$ | $0.8065$ | $108.140$ | $-3.48\%$ | $r_s$ squeezed by temporal acceleration |
| $0.05$ | $0.7565$ | $100.584$ | $-4.30\%$ | $r_s$ squeezed by temporal acceleration |
| $0.06$ | $0.7096$ | $93.558$ | $-5.10\%$ | $r_s$ squeezed by temporal acceleration |

The unscreened limit demonstrates the *full dynamical capacity* of the TEP conformal factor. With the restored sign convention, a larger effective expansion rate at recombination *squeezes* $r_s$ and decreases $100\theta_s$. This is precisely the physical intuition behind environmental screening: without it, the temporal field would radically alter early-universe physics. The $z_T \sim 5$ suppression exists to *prevent* this extreme modification while allowing the intermediate-redshift effect that mimics dark energy.


![Jordan-frame dual-scan results](figures/figure_5_jordan_theta_s.png)



*Figure 2.* Jordan-frame EdS + TEP dual scan ($\Omega_\Lambda=0$). Solid line: EdS baseline at $\epsilon_T=0$ ($100\theta_s = 1.0403$); dashed: external Planck $\Lambda$CDM reference ($1.0411$). (Left) Standard model ($z_T = 5$): $r_s$ preserved and $\theta_s$ increases via $D_C$ projection. (Right) Unscreened limit ($z_T \to \infty$): strong $r_s$ squeezing when early-universe screening is disabled.

The dual-scan result establishes two complementary facts about TEP-HC's native `tep_mode`. First, the standard model correctly implements the Jordan-frame factor with $r_s$ preservation, matching the theoretical predictions of the TEP framework. Second, the unscreened limit reveals the full dynamical range of the conformal factor: it is *capable* of modifying early-universe physics, but the $z_T$ suppression *deliberately prevents* this to preserve CMB consistency. This is consistent with the environmental-screening mechanism operating as a physical necessity, not merely a phenomenological convenience.


## 6. Conclusion

This paper implements and validates the native Temporal Equivalence Principle (TEP) background-only modification in hi_class, $H_{\rm TEP}(z) = H_{\Lambda\rm CDM}(z) \times M(z)$ with $M(z) = A(z)/(1-\alpha_A(z))$ and standard General Relativistic perturbations. The companion paper TEP-C0 (Paper 26) provides the late-time evidence (Pantheon+) and the homogeneous CMB bound. The key findings are:


### 6.1 Summary of Results


- *EFT Mapping:* The TEP bi-metric framework with conformal factor $A(\phi) = \exp(\beta_A\phi/M_{\rm Pl})$ and disformal deformation $B(\phi)$ can be mapped onto the Bellini-Sawicki $\alpha_i$ functions, placing TEP within the Horndeski class. The present numerical analysis adopts the background-only realization as the baseline numerical implementation.

- *Unscreened Cosmology:* At $z \approx 1100$ the universe is deeply unscreened ($\rho \ll 20$ g/cm³), yet the transition function freezes the modification ($f_T \to 0$ for $z \gg z_T$), so the field is dynamically inert at recombination. Here "unscreened" refers to the density threshold, while the absence of a recombination-era effect follows from the redshift transition $f_T(z) \to 0$, which freezes the homogeneous cosmological mode independently of local density screening.

- *CMB Consistency Check (verified):* With the corrected transition function, hi_class native `tep_mode` preserves the sound horizon to ~6 ppm ($r_s^{\rm TEP}/r_s^{\Lambda\rm CDM} = 0.999994$) and leaves the acoustic-peak morphology unchanged. Because the sole CMB effect of a non-zero $\epsilon_T$ is a late-time angular-diameter-distance projection ($\Delta\theta_s/\theta_s = +0.185\%$ at $\epsilon_T = 0.0066$) that is largely degenerate with $H_0$, the TEP homogeneous background is difficult to distinguish from $\Lambda$CDM with a slightly shifted $H_0$ at the low-$\ell$ CMB level. The full-Planck bound from TEP-C0 (Paper 26) is tighter.

- *Cosmological Constraints:* Late-time Pantheon+ data give strong Bayesian preference for the TEP geometry (Bayes factor 131.6 vs $\Lambda$CDM; TEP-C0, Paper 26). This paper's hi_class joint MCMC yields $\epsilon_T = 0.0056 \pm 0.0043$ from a single chain (19,033 post-burn-in samples), validated by a parallel 4-chain run giving $\epsilon_T = 0.0044 \pm 0.0040$ (maximum $R-1 = 0.098$). A dedicated sensitivity test with a widened $A_{\rm planck}$ prior $[0.9, 1.25]$ converged with all parameters Gelman–Rubin $R-1 < 0.05$ (1,640 total samples), giving $\epsilon_T = 0.0047 \pm 0.0040$ and $A_{\rm planck} = 1.223 \pm 0.044$; the correlation between $A_{\rm planck}$ and $\epsilon_T$ is $r = -0.19$ with no evidence of a degeneracy cascade. The TEP constraint on the homogeneous amplitude is robust against $A_{\rm planck}$ prior systematics. TEP-C0 full-Planck joint MCMC drives the homogeneous amplitude to $(6.75 \pm 0.24) \times 10^{-6}$. Production configuration: `data/cobaya/tep_hiclass_suite.yaml`.

- *Hubble Tension:* The framework reinterprets the tension as a local environmental clock-transport effect (Paper 11), keeping the homogeneous CMB baseline $\Lambda$CDM-compatible. No modified recombination-era expansion is required.




### 6.2 Cross-Scale Consistency


TEP is distinguished among modified gravity frameworks in that it is:



- Validated at $\rho \sim 20$ g/cm³ (terrestrial atomic clocks, laboratory Cavendish)

- Tested across galactic scales (SPARC rotation curves, Gaia wide binaries)

- Consistent with early-universe cosmology (CMB acoustic peaks)



This consistency across many orders of magnitude in density—from terrestrial to cosmological scales—supports TEP as a viable framework for gravitational physics. The native TEP background-only implementation in hi_class preserves standard GR perturbations and avoids the stability issues that plague Horndeski parametrizations.


### 6.3 Alternative Explanations


Standard ΛCDM cosmology provides an excellent fit to CMB data, with Planck 2018 reporting $H_0 = 67.36 \pm 0.54$ km/s/Mpc. The Hubble tension suggests either systematic errors in local measurements or new physics. Several alternative explanations have been proposed:



- *Local systematics:* Unaccounted-for calibration errors in Cepheid distances or supernova standardization. The SH0ES team has performed extensive cross-checks, rendering this explanation disfavored but not excluded.


- *Early-universe new physics:* Additional relativistic species ($N_{\rm eff}$), modified recombination history, or interacting dark energy. These typically shift CMB acoustic peak positions, which are not observed.


- *Late-universe modified gravity:* Models that alter $H_0$ through modified expansion history. Most such models either conflict with large-scale structure measurements or fail to preserve CMB acoustic peaks.



TEP differs from these alternatives in that it predicts negligible early-universe deviations from ΛCDM: the transition function freezes the modification at recombination ($f_T \to 0$ for $z \gg z_T$), so $r_s$ is preserved to parts-per-million and the acoustic peaks are untouched (Section 5.1). The Hubble tension in TEP arises not from modified expansion, but from environment-dependent proper-time dynamics in the measurement apparatus (Cepheids in unscreened stellar atmospheres; Paper 11). This mechanism is testable through density-dependent kinematic measurements and does not require modifying the background cosmology that fits CMB data.


### 6.4 Synthesis of the Dual-Domain Framework


This analysis implements and explicitly validates the native TEP background modification within a rigorous Boltzmann solver framework. The hi_class joint MCMC (Planck 2018 low-$\ell$ + lensing + BAO + Pantheon+) gives $H_0 = 66.63 \pm 1.70$ km/s/Mpc and $\epsilon_T = 0.0056 \pm 0.0043$; TEP-C0 (Paper 26) with full Planck TTTEEE drives the homogeneous amplitude to $(6.75 \pm 0.24) \times 10^{-6}$, confirming the dual-domain picture when $\Lambda$ operates as a background energy component.


TEP operates natively alongside $\Lambda$ on the largest scales. The macroscopic temporal shear remains bounded to the conformal limit at early times, protecting the acoustic peaks, while generating localized acceleration through spatial gradients $S(\rho, z)$ at late times.

The hi_class native `tep_mode` framework developed here provides a computational implementation of the Temporal Equivalence Principle. The acoustic indistinguishability of the corrected TEP homogeneous background from $\Lambda$CDM at recombination is consistent with the dual-domain picture, where tensions are addressed through local kinematic environments rather than early-universe modifications. The implemented $M=A/(1-\alpha_A)$ form reproduces the exact frame factor $M_{\rm exact}=A(1+\alpha_A)$ for the sound horizon to identical precision (0.0 ppm); the $\theta_s$ projection differs by $<0.01\%$ at the fiducial $\epsilon_T=0.0066$, confirming the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_A^2)$ scaling expected from Appendix A.3a.

cd external/hi_class/hi_class
make clean && make
```

```


### A.3 TEP Module C Code Structure and Implementation Note

The native background-only modification is implemented directly in hi_class `source/background.c`, controlled by the `.ini` flags `tep_mode`, `epsilon_T`, `z_T`, `n_T`. The relevant functions are:


- `tep_f_transition(pba, z)`: returns the suppression factor $S(z) = \exp[-(z/z_T)^{n_T}]$; the full transition is $f_T(z) = \ln(1+z)\,S(z)$ (see `core/cosmology.py:f_T`).

- `tep_gamma_factor(pba, z)`: returns the exact covariant conformal factor $A(z) = \exp[\epsilon_T \ln(1+z)\,S(z)]$ (not linearised).

- The Hubble rate and its conformal-time derivative are multiplied by $M(z) = A/(1-\alpha_A)$ in `background_functions` and in the initial-Hubble setter; the energy densities entering the perturbation hierarchy are left standard (GR perturbations), so this is a pure background-only modification.



*Implementation note (corrected bug).* An earlier build used $f_T = 1 - \exp[-(z/z_T)^{n_T}]$ (the complement of the suppression), which saturates to $1$ for $z \gg z_T$ and therefore applied the full Hubble modification *at* recombination. This inverted the freezing mechanism, shifted $r_s$ by $0.66\%$ and $\theta_s$ by $\sim0.3\%$ ($\sim 11\sigma$ for Planck), and produced spurious few-percent $C_\ell$ residuals. In addition, the post-processing step that read the spectra used a hard-coded output index and could silently load a stale file from an earlier run. Both issues are fixed: the transition function now uses the shared TEP-C0 implementation (`core/cosmology.py`), and the analysis resolves the most recent hi_class output deterministically. *Sign convention (TEP disformal metric):* the Hubble rate is multiplied by $M(z)$ for background expansion, while the distance integrand is multiplied by $A(z)$ for null-geodesic propagation. The legacy SMG alpha-function stub (`smg_tep_*`) has been retired; production physics lives in the patched `background.c` (`external/patches/hiclass_tep_native.patch`).


### A.3a Derivation of the Jordan-Frame Factor $M(z)$

This appendix derives the background expansion modification $M(z)$ from the bi-metric action (Equation \ref{eq:3_theory_01}) using a single frame convention held fixed throughout, and states precisely the relationship between the exact result and the first-order form $M = A/(1-\alpha_A)$ implemented in the code.

*Setup and convention.* Matter, photons, and rods couple to the Jordan-frame metric $\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu} = A^2(\phi)\,g_{\mu\nu} + B(\phi)\,\nabla_\mu\phi\nabla_\nu\phi$. For the homogeneous background the disformal term contributes only through the time-time component and is absorbed into the lapse; the expansion history is governed by the conformal part, so we set $B \to 0$ here (the disformal sector re-enters at the perturbative/GW level via $\alpha_T$, Section 2.2.2). The conformal part gives the standard map between the Einstein-frame scale factor $a_E$ and cosmic time $t_E$ and their Jordan-frame counterparts:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:a3a_map}
\tilde{a} = A(\phi)\,a_E, \qquad d\tilde{t} = A(\phi)\,dt_E.
\end{equation}

These two relations *define* the convention; every subsequent equation is derived from them, so no independent redshift postulate is introduced (and none can contradict them). In particular, with $a_0 = \tilde a_0 = 1$, the Jordan-frame redshift satisfies $1+\tilde z = \tilde a^{-1} = (A\,a_E)^{-1} = (1+z_E)/A$ — i.e. the redshift relation is a *consequence* of (\ref{eq:a3a_map}), not a separate input. In the screened production regime, the transition factor $S(z)=\exp[-(z/z_T)^{n_T}]$ drives $A(z)\to1$ at recombination and at the local endpoint, so the code's redshift grid can be identified with the physical Jordan-frame redshift to the working order of this paper. The explicit $(z_E,\tilde z)$ distinction is retained only to derive the frame relation.

*Physical Hubble rate.* The expansion rate measured by Jordan-frame clocks and rulers is $\tilde H \equiv \tilde a^{-1}\,d\tilde a/d\tilde t = d\ln\tilde a/d\tilde t$. Using $d/d\tilde t = A^{-1}\,d/dt_E$ and $\ln\tilde a = \ln A + \ln a_E$,

\begin{equation} \label{eq:a3a_Htilde}
\tilde H = \frac{1}{A}\frac{d}{dt_E}\big(\ln A + \ln a_E\big) = \frac{1}{A}\Big(\frac{d\ln A}{dt_E} + H_E\Big),
\end{equation}

where $H_E = d\ln a_E/dt_E$ is the Einstein-frame rate. Writing the conformal running as a logarithmic derivative with respect to the Einstein-frame scale factor,

\begin{equation} \label{eq:a3a_alpha}
\frac{d\ln A}{dt_E} = \frac{d\ln A}{d\ln a_E}\,\frac{d\ln a_E}{dt_E} = \alpha_A\,H_E, \qquad \alpha_A \equiv \frac{d\ln A}{d\ln a_E} = -\frac{d\ln A}{d\ln(1+z)},
\end{equation}

which is identical to the coupling defined in Section 3.2 (the two expressions coincide because $\ln a_E = -\ln(1+z)$). Substituting (\ref{eq:a3a_alpha}) into (\ref{eq:a3a_Htilde}) and using the conformally transformed Friedmann equation $H_E = A^2\,H_{\Lambda\rm CDM}$ (from $\rho_E = A^4\tilde\rho$, Section 5.4) gives the **exact** geometric relation:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:a3a_exact}
\boxed{\;\tilde H(z) = A(z)\,\big(1 + \alpha_A(z)\big)\,H_{\Lambda\rm CDM}(z)\;} \qquad \Longrightarrow \qquad M_{\rm exact}(z) = A\,(1+\alpha_A).
\end{equation}

*Relation to the implemented form.* The code applies $M(z) = A/(1-\alpha_A)$. Since $1/(1-\alpha_A) = 1 + \alpha_A + \alpha_A^2 + \mathcal{O}(\alpha_A^3)$, the implemented factor reproduces the exact result (\ref{eq:a3a_exact}) to first order in $\alpha_A$ and differs only at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_A^2)$:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:a3a_diff}
\frac{M_{\rm code}}{M_{\rm exact}} = \frac{1}{(1-\alpha_A)(1+\alpha_A)} = \frac{1}{1-\alpha_A^2} = 1 + \alpha_A^2 + \mathcal{O}(\alpha_A^4).
\end{equation}

At the fiducial screened amplitude the local multiplicative difference is $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_A^2)\sim5\times10^{-5}$. Because the transition function suppresses $\alpha_A$ across the recombination integral, the induced change in the sound horizon is confirmed to be negligible for the quoted acoustic-preservation result by the direct exact-M verification scan reported below. The distinction becomes numerically relevant only in the deliberately extreme unscreened limit (Regime II, $z_T\to\infty$), where $|\alpha_A|$ is no longer small: at $\epsilon_T = 0.06$, $z\approx1100$, the two forms differ by $\approx 0.36\%$ in $M$ (and correspondingly in the squeezed $r_s$). Both forms preserve the sign of the effect ($M>1$ at high $z$, hence $r_s$ squeezing) and both vanish correctly as $\epsilon_T\to0$.

*Status.* The present implementation reproduces the exact result (\ref{eq:a3a_exact}) to first order in $\alpha_A$. A direct background-only verification scan (step 04c) confirms that the exact factor $M_{\rm exact}=A(1+\alpha_A)$ gives an identical sound horizon $r_s$ (0.0 ppm) across the full screened scan; the angular scale $\theta_s$ differs by $<0.01\%$ at the fiducial $\epsilon_T=0.0066$, growing to $\sim0.18\%$ at the extreme scan edge $\epsilon_T=0.06$, consistent with the expected $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_A^2)$ scaling. The regime where the two forms differ appreciably (Regime II, $z_T\to\infty$) is presented only as an illustrative demonstration of the unscreened dynamical range, not as a constraint.


### A.4 Screening Threshold in Cosmological Units


The 20 g/cm³ screening threshold converts to cosmological units as:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:9_appendix_01}
\rho_c = 20 \text{ g/cm}^3 = 2 \times 10^4 \text{ kg/m}^3 \approx 10^{31} \text{ eV/cm}^3
\end{equation}

In Planck units ($\hbar = c = G = 1$):

\begin{equation} \label{eq:9_appendix_02}
\rho_c \approx 4 \times 10^{-93} M_{\rm Pl}^4
\end{equation}

Compare to cosmic mean density today ($\rho_{\rm crit,0} \approx 10^{-123} M_{\rm Pl}^4$) and at recombination ($\rho \sim 10^{-114} M_{\rm Pl}^4$). The hierarchy $\rho(z=1100) \ll \rho_c$ confirms the unscreened regime.


### A.5 Stability

In a full Horndeski/EFT treatment, hi_class enforces the scalar-sector stability conditions:


- $c_s^2 \geq 0$ (no gradient instabilities)

- $\alpha_K \geq 0$ (no ghosts)

- $|\alpha_M|$ bounded (sub-luminal Planck-mass running)

- $\alpha_T \approx 0$ (GW speed constraints)



These would apply to the alpha-function mapping. The background-only realization used here does *not* activate the scalar modified-gravity sector: perturbations remain standard GR, so no scalar sound-speed, ghost, or gradient-instability constraints arise. This is the principal numerical advantage of the background-only approach, which ensures absolute stability across all cosmic epochs without requiring manual overrides for early-time stability tests.
