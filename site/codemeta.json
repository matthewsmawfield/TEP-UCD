  "name": "The Soliton Wake: Identifying the Runaway Object RBH-1 as a Gravitational Soliton",
  "description": "RBH-1, interpreted as a candidate runaway supermassive black hole, is associated with a 62 kpc linear feature. JWST spectroscopy reveals a sharp velocity discontinuity. Standard shock conditions mandate post-shock temperatures creating a cooling bottleneck that precludes observed star formation. An alternative interpretation models RBH-1 as a macroscopic gravitational soliton. A scalar-field model constrained by terrestrial atomic clocks correctly predicts the 10^7 M_sun crossover scale to within 1%, and independently predicts the Milky Way's Keplerian transition radius (~19 kpc, Gaia DR3) to within 3%, without parameter tuning.",
