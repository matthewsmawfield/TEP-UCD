<h1>6. Discussion: Implications for Dark Matter</h1>

<h2>Observational Context</h2>
<p>
    The confirmation of RBH-1 provides a rare observational laboratory for testing the interaction of a compact perturber with the circumgalactic medium. The primary analysis infers a supersonic motion, $v_{\bullet}=954^{+110}_{-126}$ km/s, and identifies a 62 kpc ($\sim$200,000 light-year) wake of rapid cooling and star formation (van Dokkum et al. 2025). Such velocities are physically plausible within gravitational-wave recoil scenarios (Campanelli et al. 2007; Colpi & Dotti 2011; Komossa 2012). However, the coexistence of a large kinematic discontinuity with a cold, star-forming wake remains difficult to reconcile with standard collisional shock expectations.
</p>

<p>
    The central tension concerns the wake rather than the recoil. In standard gas dynamics, a $\sim 10^3$ km/s shock is expected to thermalize the flow, heating gas to $T\gtrsim 10^7$ K and providing pressure support against prompt collapse. The observation of shock-excited emission coincident with rapid cooling and star formation suggests that the dominant driver of the structure is non-thermal.
</p>

<p>
    While recent hydrodynamic simulations (Ogiya & Nagai 2023) and ram-pressure stripping studies (Poggianti et al. 2019) have shown that star formation can occur in tails under specific conditions, they do not resolve the central temperature paradox of the RBH-1 shock front itself. The coexistence of a high-Mach discontinuity and a cold, star-forming environment demands a new perspective.
</p>

<h2>Resolution via Temporal Solitons</h2>
<p>
    A metric-driven interpretation offers an alternative to a purely hydrodynamic bow-shock model. If RBH-1 is modeled as a propagating region of altered proper-time rate (a temporal soliton), then the dominant observational signature at the apex could be a spatial gravitational-redshift gradient rather than irreversible collisional heating. In this scenario, the wake can remain comparatively cold while the effective collapse threshold behind the front is modified, enabling star formation without a long-lived hot phase. The trail is then interpreted as an imprint of a transient metric perturbation rather than material entrained by a compact projectile.
</p>

<p>
    Theoretical analogies exist in the form of non-topological solitons in scalar field theories (e.g., Kusenko 1997; Heeck et al. 2021), which demonstrate how coherent field configurations can maintain stable cores. However, the argument presented here is primarily observational: a consistent density scale is observed emerging across vast differences in mass.
</p>

<h2>RBH-1 as a Naked Halo Candidate</h2>
<p>
    This reinterpretation also offers a way to connect competing morphological interpretations: is RBH-1 a runaway compact object or a "bulgeless edge-on galaxy" (Sanchez Almeida et al. 2023)? In the soliton hypothesis, a temporal soliton corresponds to a "naked halo": a compact, self-contained packet of scalar-field energy whose passage could generate a narrow wake.
</p>

<p>
    One possible formation channel is a major merger or strong interaction. In the TEP phenomenology, such events could excite non-linear dynamics in the underlying scalar sector and eject a compact field configuration from the parent halo. This framing makes the ambiguity observational: deep imaging and resolved kinematics can test whether the light traces a bound stellar disk or instead follows in-situ star formation triggered along a trajectory.
</p>

<h2>Signatures of Internal Dynamics</h2>
<p>
    Two specific anomalies in the data point to the internal physics of the soliton.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>The Magnetar "Anti-Glitch": Standard neutron stars experience "glitches" (spin-ups). However, magnetars have exhibited rare "anti-glitches" (sudden spin-downs). A growing census now includes five events across four magnetars: 1E 2259+586 ($P \approx 7.0$ s) exhibited anti-glitches in both 2012 and 2019 (Archibald et al. 2013; Younes et al. 2020); 4U 0142+61 ($P \approx 8.69$ s) showed a 2015 net spin-down via over-recovery (Archibald et al. 2017); SGR 1935+2154 ($P \approx 3.25$ s) in 2020 (Younes et al. 2022); and XTE J1810-197 ($P \approx 5.54$ s) (Pintore et al. 2016). In the TEP framework, these are interpreted as boundary interactions: as the star's light cylinder expands toward the soliton scale, the magnetosphere approaches a field transition, enabling a rapid change in torque. The magnetar 1E 2259+586 is particularly significant—its period matches the TEP-predicted critical period ($P_{\rm crit} \approx 6.8$ s for a $1.4 M_{\odot}$ neutron star) to within 3%.</li>
    <li>Wake Fragmentation (Empirical Scale Tension): A key empirical constraint comes from the scale of star formation itself. The wake contains "knots" or clumps of star formation with sizes $d \lesssim 1$ kpc (van Dokkum et al. 2025). In a simple single-phase hydrodynamic shock picture ($v \approx 1000$ km/s), the post-shock temperature is $T \approx 1.4 \times 10^7$ K. At this temperature, the Jeans Length—the minimum scale for gravitational collapse—would be $L_J \approx 170$ kpc, far larger than the observed clumps. This places a strong constraint on models in which the dominant post-front phase remains very hot for an extended time; more realistic multiphase/mixing scenarios require explicit forward modeling.</li>
    <li>The Echo in the Ringdown: A future test lies in gravitational waves. When two black holes merge, the resulting "ringdown" signal decays exponentially as the event horizon absorbs the energy. If the objects are horizonless Exotic Compact Objects, gravitational waves could be partially trapped between the photon sphere and an interior reflective boundary, producing repeating pulses or "gravitational echoes" following the main merger event (Cardoso et al. 2016; Abedi et al. 2017). While current LIGO/Virgo evidence remains debated (e.g., Westerweck et al. 2018), next-generation detectors can provide substantially stronger constraints on such scenarios.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    Disputed case: an archival anti-glitch in 1E 1841-045 (P ≈ 11.78 s) has been reported (Şaşmaz Muş et al. 2014) but disputed by a reanalysis (Dib & Kaspi 2014); it is not counted among confirmed events here.
</p>

<h3>Supplementary: Anti-/Net Spin-down outside the magnetar class</h3>
<p>
    Related phenomena have been identified in other neutron-star systems, providing broader context for rapid torque reversals. These are not magnetars and are listed here for completeness.
    The magnetar-focused census above remains the primary TEP comparison set.

<h2>Dark Matter as Phantom Mass</h2>
<p>
    A significant implication lies in the scaling. A single length scale, calibrated from the coherence of atomic clocks on Earth, successfully predicts the physical properties of RBH-1. The implied core saturation density, $\rho_c \sim 19\text{--}20\,\mathrm{g/cm^3}$, suggests that the "dark sector" is not a swarm of collisionless particles, but a structured field that saturates at a characteristic limit. In the TEP view, dark matter halos are the diffuse, unscreened tails of this field structure—gradients in the proper-time rate that appear as "phantom mass" when analyzed under an isochronous prior.
</p>

<p>
    Standard dynamical and lensing inferences typically assume an isochronous prior: once the gravitational potential is specified, the mapping between observed redshifts, light travel times, and inferred mass is treated as fixed. In TEP's bi-metric framework, the conformal sector (the clock-rate field $\phi$) can contribute an additional integrated delay—a refractive index effect—even when the baryonic potential is held fixed. When such a contribution is interpreted within an isochronous GR prior, it appears observationally as an excess or "phantom" mass component. This is the TEP interpretation of dark matter: not missing particles, but unmodeled temporal structure. The "dark sector" is the conformal metric sector that GW170817 does not constrain.
</p>

<p>
    From GNSS to Cosmos: The jump from terrestrial clock correlations to galactic structure requires justification. The present analysis treats the reported coherence length $L_c \approx 4200$ km as an empirical calibration parameter (Smawfield 2025a) and asks whether a single calibration can organize disparate phenomena into a falsifiable pattern. By extrapolating this scale to the mass of a supermassive black hole, the hypothesis that the same field sector behaves consistently across scales is tested.
</p>

<h2>Cosmological Regularities</h2>
<p>
    This view is not isolated. Independent of the RBH-1 anomaly, galactic dynamics offer strong hints that the dark sector is tightly coupled to the baryonic one. The Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR) reveals that dark matter's dynamical effect is strictly determined by the baryon distribution (McGaugh, Lelli, &amp; Schombert 2016). Similarly, the Baryonic Tully–Fisher Relation (BTFR) links total mass to rotation velocity with remarkable tightness (McGaugh et al. 2000), and halo cores exhibit a nearly constant surface density across magnitudes of scale (Donato et al. 2009).
</p>

<p>
    These regularities are difficult to explain if dark matter is a free parameter in every galaxy. However, they arise naturally if the "dark" influence is a structured response of the metric—a field effect constrained by the baryons themselves. The SPARC analysis (Section 4) confirms this connection quantitatively: the radius where the rotation curve diverges from Newtonian prediction scales as $R_{\rm DM} \propto M_{\rm bar}^{0.35 \pm 0.01}$, consistent with the $M^{1/3}$ soliton scaling predicted by TEP. The RBH-1 wake may simply be the most dramatic manifestation of this coherent, field-like behavior.
</p>

<h3>Convergent Scaling from Fuzzy Dark Matter Simulations</h3>
<p>
    The $M^{1/3}$ scaling central to the TEP framework has been independently discovered in a completely different theoretical context. Schive et al. (2014) performed 3D cosmological simulations of "fuzzy" or "wave" dark matter—ultralight bosons ($m \sim 10^{-22}$ eV) described by the Schrödinger-Poisson equation—and found that solitonic cores obey a core-halo mass relation $M_c \propto M_h^{1/3}$. This scaling emerges from the uncertainty principle and the requirement that the de Broglie wavelength match the halo virial velocity.
</p>

<p>
    The convergence is striking: TEP derives $R \propto M^{1/3}$ from a saturation density argument in the conformal sector; FDM derives $M_c \propto M_h^{1/3}$ from quantum pressure in a scalar field. Both frameworks predict the same structural scaling, suggesting a deeper connection between the phenomenology of coherent scalar fields and the observed regularities in galactic dynamics. While the microphysical details differ—TEP invokes a conformal time-field with Vainshtein screening, FDM invokes ultralight axions with wave interference—the macroscopic outcome is identical: solitonic cores with density-limited radii scaling as the cube root of mass.
</p>

<div>
<p>Observational discriminants: Within this framework, the features that make RBH-1 difficult to accommodate in standard hydrodynamics become its defining signatures.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Rapid post-front cooling without an extended hot X-ray halo.</li>
    <li>An extremely narrow, non-dispersive wake.</li>
    <li>Clumpy, immediate star formation.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Soliton Stripping: The DF2/DF4 Natural Experiment</h3>
<p>
    The ultra-diffuse galaxies NGC 1052-DF2 and NGC 1052-DF4 present a striking anomaly: they appear to contain little or no dark matter, based on their low velocity dispersions (van Dokkum et al. 2018, 2019). In the standard ΛCDM framework, this is difficult to explain—galaxies are expected to form within dark matter halos.
</p>

<p>
    Recent work proposes that DF2 and DF4 formed in a "bullet-dwarf" collision ~8 Gyr ago, where gas separated from dark matter in a high-velocity encounter (van Dokkum et al. 2022). A trail of 7–11 dark-matter-free galaxies extends over 2 Mpc, with dark-matter-dominated remnants tentatively identified at the leading edges.
</p>

<p>
    In the TEP framework, this natural experiment has a direct interpretation: the collision stripped the coherent scalar field (the soliton) from the baryonic component. The "dark-matter-free" galaxies are soliton-stripped; the "dark-matter-dominated" remnants retain the soliton structure. This is analogous to ram-pressure stripping of gas, but for the conformal field sector.
</p>

<p>
    A testable prediction follows: the remnant galaxies (RCP 32 and DF7) should exhibit the same $M^{1/3}$ scaling as other soliton-dominated objects. Their dynamical masses should exceed their baryonic masses by a factor consistent with the TEP screening hierarchy.
</p>

<h3>The Milky Way Keplerian Decline: A Quantitative Test</h3>
<p>
    Gaia DR3 has enabled the first detection of a Keplerian decline in the Milky Way rotation curve (Jiao et al. 2023). The velocity decreases by ~30 km/s between 19.5 and 26.5 kpc, with a flat rotation curve rejected at 3σ significance. This marks the edge of the dark matter halo—or, in TEP terms, the soliton boundary.
</p>

<p>
    The transition radius provides a quantitative test of the $M^{1/3}$ scaling. Using the terrestrial calibration ($L_{c,\oplus} = 4200$ km for $M_\oplus$), the TEP-predicted soliton radius for the Milky Way's baryonic mass ($M_{\rm bar} \sim 6 \times 10^{10} M_\odot$) is:
</p>

<div class="equation">
    $$R_{\rm sol,MW} = L_{c,\oplus} \times \left(\frac{M_{\rm bar}}{M_\oplus}\right)^{1/3} = 4200 \text{ km} \times \left(\frac{6 \times 10^{10} \times 2 \times 10^{30}}{6 \times 10^{24}}\right)^{1/3} \approx 18.5 \text{ kpc}$$
</div>

<p>
    The observed Keplerian transition at $R_{\rm obs} \approx 19$ kpc agrees with the TEP prediction to within 3%, consistent within systematic uncertainty in the adopted transition definition. This constitutes cross-regime consistency of the universal scaling law spanning from Earth (kg) to the Milky Way ($10^{11} M_\odot$), a range of 41 orders of magnitude.
</p>

<h2>Additional JWST Case Studies Consistent with a TEP Refractive Sector</h2>
<p>
    The RBH-1 anomaly is not the only recent JWST result that appears to strain standard interpretive assumptions. Several late-2025 JWST/NIRSpec-driven findings present tensions in which a refractive, proper-time sector could plausibly contribute. The aim of this subsection is not to claim that TEP explains these datasets uniquely, but to identify concrete observables where a temporal-field contribution can be tested against standard models.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Little Red Dots (LRDs): JWST has revealed a population of compact sources at $z \gtrsim 3$ with distinctive UV-optical continua and broad Balmer emission. Late-2025 population studies based on public NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy report samples of order $\sim 10^2$ objects and conclude that broad Balmer lines are widespread in LRD-selected sources (de Graaff et al. 2025; Barro et al. 2025). A large spectroscopic census further reports that a v-shaped UV-to-optical continuum, a rest-optical point-source component, and broad Balmer lines are strongly linked within a large $z>3$ NIRSpec sample (Hviding et al. 2025). Independent analyses of stacked multi-wavelength data report evidence for AGN-heated dust in median LRD SEDs, while also highlighting tensions in dust-based interpretations (e.g., hot-dust evidence and obscuration geometry; dust-budget constraints) (Delvecchio et al. 2025; Chen et al. 2025).
        <br><br>
        In a conservative TEP reinterpretation, part of the apparent broad-line width could include a gravitational-redshift component produced by a structured clock-rate field, in addition to virial motion and radiative-transfer effects.
        Discrimination requires separating kinematic broadening from redshift gradients using reverberation mapping, spatially resolved spectroscopy, and host-mass constraints.
</li>
    <li>
        Massive quiescent galaxies at high redshift: PRIMER+JADES analyses report a mass-complete catalog of 225 quiescent candidates at $z>2$ with $M_{*} > 10^{10}\,M_{\odot}$ over $\sim 320$ arcmin$^2$, and infer number densities that exceed representative pre-JWST estimates by factors of order a few, while noting that simulations increasingly fall short at $z>3$ with discrepancies approaching $\sim 1$ dex (Stevenson et al. 2025).
        <br><br>
        In a time-field phenomenology, part of the tension could arise from inference systematics if clock-rate gradients contribute an additional refractive component to observables in dense environments.
        Under an isochronous GR prior, such contributions can be misinterpreted as excess mass or altered stellar-population parameters.
        A practical check is to compare SED-based stellar masses to independent dynamical and lensing constraints (where available), and to test whether residuals correlate with environment rather than with purely baryonic tracers alone.
</li>
    <li>
        Strong-lensing time-delay cosmography with JWST kinematics: the TDCOSMO 2025 analysis reports new JWST-NIRSpec stellar-kinematics spectra for multiple time-delay lenses (including spatially resolved kinematics for RX J1131−1231) and emphasizes that improved kinematics can break lensing degeneracies and sharpen cosmological inference (TDCOSMO Collaboration 2025).
        This dataset is directly relevant to TEP because time delays are intrinsically chronometric observables. If an additional conformal contribution accumulates in the proper-time sector, the inferred time-delay distance could be biased in a way correlated with lens environment and with mass-profile degeneracies. A decisive test is therefore to search for residual systematics that correlate with independent indicators of temporal structure, rather than with purely baryonic tracers alone.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Theoretical Bookend: The Quantum Connection</h2>
<p>
    The scaling law $R \propto M^{1/3}$ discussed in the context of RBH-1 and magnetars can be formally extrapolated to much smaller masses. Such cross-scale extrapolations carry a risk of coincidental agreement, so the result below is presented as a motivated boundary condition on the phenomenology rather than as an independent validation. Applying the same terrestrial calibration ($L_{c,\oplus} \approx 4200$ km) to the proton mass ($M_p \approx 1.67 \times 10^{-27}$ kg) gives:
</p>

<div>
    $$R_{\rm sol}(M_p) \approx 4200 \text{ km} \times \left( \frac{1.67 \times 10^{-27}}{5.97 \times 10^{24}} \right)^{1/3} \approx 2.7 \times 10^{-11} \text{ m}$$
</div>

<p>
    Numerically, this corresponds to $R \approx 0.51 a_0$, where $a_0 \approx 5.29 \times 10^{-11}$ m is the Bohr radius.
</p>

<h3>Critical Density Implication</h3>
<p>
    The relevance of the scaling is that $R \propto M^{1/3}$ implies a constant characteristic (saturation) density:
    $$\rho_c \approx \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R_{\rm sol}^3} \sim 20\,\mathrm{g/cm^3}$$
</p>

<p>
    It is important to clarify that this $\rho_c$ is an <em>effective</em> (mass-equivalent) energy density associated with the condensed soliton core, not the baryonic mass density of an ordinary fluid. The diffuse halo field can remain extremely dilute even when its condensed core saturates at a finite value. In this phenomenology, the vacuum supports a maximum time-dilation gradient before phase-locking, analogous to a saturation limit in condensed scalar configurations.
</p>

<p>
    Under this interpretation, systems with effective densities approaching $\rho_c$ provide a natural locus for crossover behavior in the proposed time-field sector. A rigorous assessment of the atomic-scale correspondence would require an explicit null hypothesis and a defined selection function; it is therefore treated as a suggestive constraint to be revisited as the theory and its observational tests are sharpened.
</p>

<h2>Comparative Likelihood</h2>
<p>
    Finally, the credibility of the two frameworks is evaluated based on parameter parsimony (Occam's Razor).
</p>
<p>
    A qualitative comparison can be made in terms of model complexity and the number of independent assumptions required to reproduce the joint set of phenomena discussed in this work.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>A rare gravitational recoil event (merger kick).</li>
    <li>Circumgalactic medium conditions and microphysics that permit star formation in a high-speed wake.</li>
    <li>An explanation for magnetar period clustering in the few-second range (if interpreted as non-coincidental).</li>
    <li>A dark-matter sector model consistent with non-detections and small-scale structure constraints.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The TEP framework uses an empirically inferred terrestrial calibration scale, $L_c \approx 4200$ km, and explores whether a single saturation-density parameter can organize multiple independent datasets into a falsifiable pattern. Under this calibration, the following cross-regime consistencies are identified:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>RBH-1 resides near the crossover mass scale where the GNSS-calibrated soliton radius and the Schwarzschild diameter coincide at the percent level within stated uncertainties.</li>
    <li>A Milky Way transition radius near ~19 kpc at the few-percent level within systematic uncertainty in the adopted definition.</li>
    <li>A magnetar-period scale near several seconds, treated as a phenomenological consistency check rather than a unique signature.</li>
    <li>An atomic-scale correspondence treated as a boundary-condition constraint, not an independent validation.</li>
    <li>A screening hierarchy consistent with $S \propto \rho^{1/3}$ under the stated definitions across many density decades ($R^2 = 0.9999$).</li>
    <li>Consistency with precision GR tests via strong screening in high-density regimes.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The Vainshtein screening analysis (Section 3b) provides a particularly compelling consistency test (visualized in Figure 6). The empirical relationship $S \propto \rho^{0.334}$ was not imposed—it emerged from 26 astrophysical measurements spanning planets, stars, white dwarfs, neutron stars, and binary pulsars. That this exponent matches the theoretical prediction (1/3, a direct consequence of $R_{sol} \propto M^{1/3}$) to within 0.3% demonstrates cross-regime consistency under a single $\rho_c$.
</p>
<p>
    Furthermore, the screening hierarchy resolves a potential objection: if a scalar field exists, why has it not been detected in precision gravitational tests? The answer is quantitative: at nuclear densities ($\rho \sim 10^{14}$ g/cm³), screening factors reach 30,000×, suppressing scalar contributions to less than 0.003% of orbital dynamics. The Hulse-Taylor pulsar's 0.2% agreement with GR is not violated—it is explained.
</p>
<p>
    The appearance of a single terrestrial calibration across atomic, stellar, and galactic scales is nontrivial. However, a formal statistical assessment would require an explicit null hypothesis and selection function. The present argument is therefore best read as a parsimony-motivated, falsification-forward hypothesis: if the soliton picture is wrong, it should fail cleanly under the proposed observational discriminants.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<div class="principle">
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>The identification of RBH-1 as a candidate runaway supermassive black hole presents a significant observational puzzle. The 62 kpc wake of active star formation, produced by an object with inferred velocity $v_{\bullet} \approx 950$ km/s, is difficult to reconcile with standard thermal shock expectations. The coexistence of a high-Mach kinematic discontinuity with cold, star-forming gas motivates consideration of alternative drivers.</p>

<p>The TEP interpretation offers a resolution: RBH-1 may represent a gravitational soliton rather than a conventional black hole. In this framework, the wake forms not through thermal compression but through a metric-induced reduction in the effective Jeans mass, enabling star formation without a prolonged hot phase.</p>
</div>

<p>
    This analysis concludes that RBH-1 is consistent with a macroscopic gravitational soliton operating as a temporal soliton in the time-dilation sector: its wake phenomenology is naturally described as a metric-driven instability front rather than a purely thermal shock. The explanatory economy of this interpretation is that it simultaneously addresses (i) the narrow, coherent morphology, (ii) the apparent coldness implied by rapid cooling diagnostics, and (iii) the crossover scale suggested by the GNSS-calibrated scaling law.
</p>

<p>
    If verified, this result implies that the "Dark Sector" is not a hidden particle zoo, but a predictable dynamical feature of the metric itself—the conformal time-field sector of TEP. What is conventionally called "dark matter" is phantom mass: the apparent excess inferred when temporal shear is analyzed under an isochronous prior. The soliton wake of RBH-1 may be the most direct observational signature of this temporal structure, linking the ticking of an atomic clock on Earth to the formation of stars in the wake of a distant galactic giant.
</p>

<p>
    A potential objection concerns the apparent "shadows" imaged for M87* and Sgr A* by the Event Horizon Telescope. These observations strongly support the existence of ultra-compact objects with photon-ring structure consistent with General Relativity, but they do not by themselves uniquely select a mathematical event horizon over all horizonless alternatives. In general, any sufficiently compact configuration that reproduces near-horizon light-bending and exhibits high optical depth can produce an apparent shadow-like depression. The RBH-1 hypothesis therefore does not require that all supermassive black holes be identical solitons; rather, it motivates a targeted comparison between RBH-1 and EHT-class objects, with particular emphasis on whether the central brightness depression behaves as a true absorbing horizon or as a saturating refractive core (Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration 2019; Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration 2022).
</p>

<p>
    The key next step is falsification. The soliton hypothesis makes concrete observational predictions:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>The "Hollow" Lens: Unlike a black hole, a soliton has no singularity and thus no true event horizon shadow. High-resolution imaging (VLBI) should reveal a central caustic—a bright spot or smooth lensing distortion through the center—rather than a dark silhouette.</li>
    <li>Line-Width Thermometry: Spectra should show redshift discontinuities with suppressed thermal broadening (the "Cold Shock").</li>
    <li>Wake Substructure: Star formation should be modulated by the internal "breathing" dynamics of the scalar field.</li>
    <li>Wake Chronometry: Stellar population ages along the wake should be consistent with the transit time of the perturber across the observed wake length (distance/$v_{\bullet}$). Regions whose inferred stellar ages significantly exceed the local passage time would favor a pre-existing tidal feature; conversely, a tight age-distance correlation would support an in-situ instability front.</li>
</ul>

<div class="principle">
<h4>Box 6.1: Falsifiers — What Would Rule Out the Metric-Shock Interpretation</h4>
<p>The following observations would falsify the TEP soliton hypothesis for RBH-1:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Hot X-ray Halo:</strong> Detection of extended X-ray emission ($T \gtrsim 10^7$ K) coincident with the wake would indicate thermal shock heating, contradicting the metric-shock model.</li>
    <li><strong>Thermal Line Widths:</strong> If [O III] or H$\alpha$ line widths at the apex exceed $\sigma \gtrsim 80$ km/s (consistent with $T \sim 10^7$ K thermalization), the cold-shock interpretation fails.</li>
    <li><strong>Wake Broadening:</strong> If the wake aspect ratio decreases to $\lesssim 10:1$ at large distances (indicating Kelvin-Helmholtz turbulent mixing), the laminar metric-shock model is excluded.</li>
    <li><strong>Polarized Heart Null:</strong> If ngEHT observations of M87* or Sgr A* achieve $>100:1$ dynamic range and robustly constrain polarization in the central brightness depression to be consistent with zero under validated, prior-robust pipelines and matched synthetic-observation null tests, a broad class of horizonless models with emitting interiors would be strongly disfavored for those objects.</li>
    <li><strong>Scaling Violation:</strong> If the Milky Way's Keplerian transition radius or RBH-1's crossover scale deviate from the $M^{1/3}$ prediction by $>3\sigma$ after accounting for mass uncertainties, the universal scaling law is falsified.</li>
</ol>
</div>
