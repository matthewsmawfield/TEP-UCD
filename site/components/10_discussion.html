<h2>9. Discussion: The Nature of the Dark Sector</h2>

<h2>Synthesis of Multi-Scale Evidence</h2>

<p>The central result of this work is the identification of a single density scale, $\rho_c \approx 20$ g/cm³, that organizes gravitational anomalies across 40 orders of magnitude in mass. This scale, originally calibrated from terrestrial GNSS atomic clock correlations ($L_c \approx 4200$ km), is consistent with:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The atomic scale boundary condition ($R_{\text{sol}}(m_p) \sim a_0$).</li>
    <li>The critical spin period of magnetars ($P_{\text{crit}} \approx 6.8$ s).</li>
    <li>The dark matter onset radius in spiral galaxies ($R_{\text{DM}} \propto M^{1/3}$).</li>
    <li>The Keplerian transition radius of the Milky Way ($R \approx 19$ kpc).</li>
    <li>The screening hierarchy in binary pulsars vs. galaxies ($S \propto \rho^{1/3}$).</li>
</ul>

<p>The convergence of these independent constraints suggests that $\rho_c$ is not merely a fitting parameter for a specific system, but a candidate universal parameter of the effective description of the dark sector, within the stated uncertainties.</p>

<h4>Claim Hierarchy and Falsification Scope</h4>
<p>
    The empirical content of this work can be read at three distinct levels. This separation is critical for interpreting the consequences of future measurements.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Level 1 (Empirical regularities):</strong> The existence of approximate $M^{1/3}$ scaling features in rotation-curve onset radii, and the density-ordered screening hierarchy summarized by $S = R_{\text{sol}}/R_{\text{phys}}$.</li>
    <li><strong>Level 2 (Universal-density soliton model):</strong> The hypothesis that a single saturation density $\rho_c$ organizes these regularities via $R_{\text{sol}}(M) = (3M/4\pi\rho_c)^{1/3}$, with GNSS providing an empirical calibration (subject to independent replication) and cross-regime consistency tests (SPARC ensemble, magnetars, Milky Way, RBH-1 crossover).</li>
    <li><strong>Level 3 (TEP microphysics):</strong> The full dynamical realization in which temporal shear and a conformal time field $\Omega(\phi)$ generate the effective soliton/screening phenomenology. Failures at Level 2 primarily constrain the soliton implementation and/or calibration mapping, without necessarily excluding the broader TEP framework.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Dark Matter as Phantom Mass</h2>

<p>In the TEP framework, "dark matter" is reinterpreted not as a particle species, but as "phantom mass"—an apparent excess inferred when a geometry with temporal shear (two metrics) is analyzed under the assumption of isochrony (single metric). The saturation density $\rho_c$ represents the scale at which the conformal time field $\Omega$ enters a non-linear, self-supporting phase (the soliton).</p>

<p>This explains the phenomenology of "cores" in dark matter halos. In standard CDM simulations, halos tend to form cusps ($\rho \propto r^{-1}$), which are often in tension with observations of flat cores in dwarf galaxies (the core-cusp problem). In the soliton picture, the core is a distinct physical state—a Bose-Einstein condensate-like configuration of the scalar field—that naturally supports a flat density profile with a characteristic radius $R_{\text{sol}}$.</p>

<h2>Comparison with Alternative Frameworks</h2>

<p>
    The TEP framework shares phenomenological features with both Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) and Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) but is distinguished by its screening mechanism and cross-scale predictive power.

<h3>TEP vs. MOND</h3>
<p>
    MOND provides an excellent fit to galaxy rotation curves but offers no explanation for the GNSS clock correlations or magnetar anti-glitches. TEP recovers MOND-like phenomenology ($a_0 \sim G \Sigma_c$) as an emergent property of the screening transition, while correctly predicting the density-dependent suppression required for precision GR tests.
</p>

<h3>TEP vs. FDM</h3>
<p>
    Standard FDM predicts solitonic cores but struggles with "catching" the right scale for both dwarf galaxies and the Milky Way simultaneously without fine-tuning the particle mass. TEP naturally links the core scale to the saturation density, which is independently constrained by atomic physics.
</p>

<h2>Resolving Galactic Anomalies</h2>

<h3>The Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR)</h3>
<p>The SPARC analysis (Section 3) confirms that the onset of mass discrepancies follows the baryonic mass distribution, a key feature of the Radial Acceleration Relation (McGaugh et al. 2016). In TEP, this coupling is a natural consequence of the assumed sourcing: the scalar field is sourced by the trace of the energy-momentum tensor ($T^\mu_\mu$), so the "dark matter" halo is directly anchored to the baryonic mass. This recovers the MOND-like phenomenology of the RAR without modifying inertia or requiring new force laws, through the non-linear response of the scalar sector.</p>

<h3>Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies (DF2/DF4)</h3>
<p>The "dark matter free" galaxies NGC 1052-DF2 and DF4 pose a challenge to theories where dark matter and baryons are dynamically coupled. TEP resolves this via "soliton stripping." Unlike a particulate halo, the scalar envelope can be physically stripped from the baryons during high-velocity encounters (as proposed by van Dokkum et al. 2022). The remaining baryonic component would appear devoid of dark matter until it re-equilibrates a new (smaller) soliton, a process governed by the field relaxation timescale.</p>

<h2>Systematic Uncertainties</h2>

<p>The primary uncertainty in the global fit remains the GNSS calibration length $L_c$. While the value $4200 \pm 500$ km is robust across analysis centers and time, the geometric factor relating this length to the spherical soliton radius depends on the Earth's precise mass distribution and the scalar coupling strength. The adopted value $\rho_c \approx 20$ g/cm³ carries a $\sim 50\%$ systematic uncertainty. Importantly, this uncertainty is far smaller than the 15-order-of-magnitude dynamic range over which the model is tested, preserving the falsifiability of the scaling law.</p>

<h2>Predictions for High-Redshift JWST Observations</h2>

<p>The TEP framework makes concrete predictions for the "Little Red Dots"—compact, massive galaxies at $z > 5$ discovered by JWST. These objects are a critical testing ground because they are compact enough to be dominated by the soliton core, yet massive enough to be resolved.</p>

<h3>Specific Testable Predictions</h3>
<p>For a target galaxy with stellar mass $M_* = 10^{10} M_\odot$ (typical of LRDs), assuming $\rho_c = 20 \pm 8$ g/cm³, the TEP model predicts:</p>

<div class="result-box">
    <h4>1. Soliton Radius (Emission Extent)</h4>
    <p>
        The characteristic radius of the scalar envelope is:
        $$ R_{\text{sol}} = \left( \frac{3(10^{10} M_\odot)}{4\pi \rho_c} \right)^{1/3} \approx 8.4 \pm 2.8 \text{ kpc} $$
        <strong>Prediction:</strong> The observed half-light radius (or emission extent of gas tracers like H$\alpha$) should correlate with mass as $R \propto M^{1/3}$ and normalize to $\sim 8$ kpc for $10^{10} M_\odot$. This is significantly larger than the compact sizes ($r_e < 1$ kpc) typically inferred from continuum fitting if interpreted as pure stellar density, but consistent with extended gas dynamical tracers.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="result-box">
    <h4>2. Velocity Dispersion</h4>
    <p>
        The dynamical support speed is set by the soliton potential:
        $$ \sigma_v \approx \sqrt{\frac{G M}{R_{\text{sol}}}} \approx 160 \pm 40 \text{ km/s} $$
        <strong>Prediction:</strong> Integrated velocity dispersions should cluster around this value, independent of the apparent compactness of the central stellar core.
    </p>
</div>

<h3>Discriminant: Soliton vs. Supermassive Black Hole</h3>
<p>
    A leading alternative explanation is that LRDs are reddened Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) powered by supermassive black holes ($M_{\text{BH}} \sim 10^7$–$10^8 M_\odot$).
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>AGN Hypothesis:</strong> Emission should be point-like or confined to the nuclear region ($< 1$ kpc). Broad lines reflect BLR physics ($v > 1000$ km/s).</li>
    <li><strong>TEP Soliton Hypothesis:</strong> Emission should be extended over the soliton scale ($~8$ kpc). Broad lines reflect the deep gravitational potential of the soliton well ($\sim 200$ km/s).</li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Discriminant:</strong> Spatially resolve the H$\alpha$ emission. Extended emission on $\sim 5$–10 kpc scales would disfavor a purely nuclear AGN interpretation, while strongly compact emission would favor an AGN-dominated explanation. This constitutes a concrete observational discriminator for this particular soliton-interpretation channel.
</p>

<h2>Implications for Paper 8 (RBH-1)</h2>

<p>The universality of $\rho_c$ established here provides the foundation for the analysis of RBH-1 in the companion paper (Smawfield 2025h). By adopting $\rho_c \approx 20$ g/cm³ (with stated uncertainty), the soliton interpretation for RBH-1 becomes tightly constrained. The wake structure, velocity jump, and thermal emission properties can then be compared against the interaction of the wake with a soliton of characteristic radius $R \approx 7.8 \times 10^7$ km. Deviations would primarily constrain the object-specific soliton interpretation and/or the assumed mapping between $\rho_c$ and the effective radius in this environment, rather than the broader TEP framework.</p>
