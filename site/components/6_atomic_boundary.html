<h2>5. Atomic-Scale Boundary Condition</h2>

<p>A natural question arises: why does the saturation density take the value \(\rho_c \approx 20\) g/cm³? This section argues that \(\rho_c\) is not an arbitrary fit parameter but is constrained by independent physical requirements. The GNSS coherence length \(L_c\) is a derived quantity; the fundamental parameter is the saturation density itself.</p>

<h3>5.1 Reframing: \(\rho_c\) as Fundamental, \(L_c\) as Derived</h3>

<p>The soliton scaling law \(R_{sol} \propto M^{1/3}\) implies a constant characteristic density:</p>

<div class="equation">$$\rho_c = \frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R_{sol}^3} = \text{constant}$$</div>

<p>For any object of mass \(M\), the soliton radius is determined by:</p>

<div class="equation">$$R_{sol}(M) = \left(\frac{3M}{4\pi \rho_c}\right)^{1/3}$$</div>

<p>The terrestrial coherence length \(L_c \approx 4200\) km is therefore not an independent input but follows automatically once \(\rho_c\) is specified:</p>

<div class="equation">$$L_{c,\oplus} = \left(\frac{3 M_\oplus}{4\pi \rho_c}\right)^{1/3} \approx 4200 \text{ km} \quad \text{for } \rho_c \approx 19\text{–}20 \text{ g/cm}^3$$</div>

<p>The question thus reduces to: what fixes \(\rho_c\)?</p>

<h3>5.2 The Bohr Radius Constraint</h3>

<p>A remarkable consistency emerges when the scaling law is extrapolated to the proton mass. If the same \(M^{1/3}\) relation holds at quantum scales, then:</p>

<div class="equation">$$R_{sol}(m_p) = L_{c,\oplus} \times \left(\frac{m_p}{M_\oplus}\right)^{1/3}$$</div>

<p>Substituting \(L_{c,\oplus} = 4200\) km, \(m_p = 1.67 \times 10^{-27}\) kg, and \(M_\oplus = 5.97 \times 10^{24}\) kg:</p>

<div class="equation">$$R_{sol}(m_p) \approx 4200 \text{ km} \times \left(\frac{1.67 \times 10^{-27}}{5.97 \times 10^{24}}\right)^{1/3} \approx 2.7 \times 10^{-11} \text{ m}$$</div>

<p>This value is \(0.51 \, a_0\), where \(a_0 = 5.29 \times 10^{-11}\) m is the Bohr radius. The proximity to the atomic scale is striking: the soliton radius at the proton mass matches the characteristic size of the hydrogen atom to within a factor of two.</p>

<div class="principle">
<h4>Interpretation</h4>
<p>If the scalar field is to reproduce atomic-scale physics at the proton mass—a natural boundary condition for any theory that couples to matter—then, conditional on the persistence of the soliton scaling into the quantum regime, the saturation density \(\rho_c\) is not a free parameter. It is constrained by the requirement:</p>
<div class="equation">$$R_{sol}(m_p) \sim a_0$$</div>
<p>This constraint determines \(\rho_c\) to within a factor of order unity, yielding \(\rho_c \sim 10\text{–}50\) g/cm³. The observed value \(\rho_c \approx 20\) g/cm³ lies squarely within this range.</p>
</div>

<h3>5.3 The Electron Degeneracy Threshold</h3>

<p>Independent physical significance attaches to \(\rho_c \approx 20\) g/cm³: this density marks the transition from thermal to quantum pressure support in condensed matter. Below this threshold, ordinary thermal and electrostatic forces dominate the equation of state. Above it, electron degeneracy pressure becomes the primary support mechanism.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #666;"><em>Table 5.1: Equation of state transitions by density. The saturation density \(\rho_c \approx 20\) g/cm³ coincides with the onset of electron degeneracy.</em></p>

<p>This coincidence is unlikely to be accidental; rather, it suggests that the scalar sector may couple fundamentally to the Pauli exclusion principle or the quantum state of matter, rather than bulk mass density alone. The Vainshtein screening mechanism becomes relevant where quantum effects begin to dominate the equation of state—this points to a possible connection between gravitational soliton formation and quantum statistical mechanics.</p>

<h3>5.4 Dimensional Analysis: The Scalar Coupling Scale</h3>

<p>A characteristic density can be constructed from atomic constants. Consider the mass-energy density associated with a scalar field of Compton wavelength \(\lambda_\phi\), where \(c\) represents the standard speed of light (characterizing the screened matter sector):</p>

<div class="equation">$$\rho_\phi \sim \frac{m_\phi c^2}{\lambda_\phi^3}$$</div>

<p>For the scalar field to couple at atomic scales (\(\lambda_\phi \sim a_0\)), the effective mass is \(m_\phi \sim \hbar / (a_0 c) \sim \alpha m_e\), where \(\alpha \approx 1/137\) is the fine structure constant. This yields:</p>

<div class="equation">$$\rho_\phi \sim \frac{(\alpha m_e)^4 c^5}{\hbar^3} \sim 10^1 \text{ g/cm}^3$$</div>

<p>The order-of-magnitude agreement with \(\rho_c \approx 20\) g/cm³ is encouraging. A rigorous derivation from the TEP Lagrangian would pin down the numerical prefactor, but the dimensional scaling already indicates that the saturation density emerges naturally from atomic physics, not from cosmological coincidence.</p>

<h3>5.5 Status: Phenomenological Constraint, Awaiting Lagrangian Derivation</h3>

<p>The present analysis establishes that \(\rho_c \approx 20\) g/cm³ is constrained by three independent requirements:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Bohr radius matching:</strong> \(R_{sol}(m_p) \sim a_0\) requires \(\rho_c \sim 10\text{–}50\) g/cm³</li>
    <li><strong>Electron degeneracy onset:</strong> \(\rho_c\) coincides with the quantum-classical EOS transition</li>
    <li><strong>Dimensional analysis:</strong> Scalar coupling at atomic scales yields \(\rho_\phi \sim 10^1\) g/cm³</li>
</ol>

<p>These constraints are phenomenological—they identify what the theory must reproduce, not how it does so. A complete derivation from the TEP Lagrangian, specifying the scalar potential \(V(\phi)\) and coupling function \(A(\phi)\), remains a target for future theoretical work. The key point for the present manuscript is that \(\rho_c\) is not arbitrary: it is fixed by the requirement of consistency with atomic physics.</p>

<h4>Box 5.1: Summary — The Saturation Density is Not a Free Parameter</h4>
<p>The GNSS coherence length \(L_c \approx 4200\) km is often cited as the calibration input for the TEP scaling law. This framing obscures the underlying physics. The fundamental parameter is the saturation density \(\rho_c \approx 20\) g/cm³, which is constrained by:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Bohr radius at the proton mass (quantum boundary condition)</li>
    <li>The electron degeneracy threshold (equation of state physics)</li>
    <li>Dimensional analysis of scalar field coupling (theoretical consistency)</li>
</ul>
<p>The terrestrial coherence length follows as a derived quantity. GNSS observations do not determine \(\rho_c\); they measure it in the most accessible laboratory: Earth's gravitational field.</p>
