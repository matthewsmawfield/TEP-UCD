    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>RBH-1, interpreted as a candidate runaway supermassive black hole, is associated with a 62 kpc ($\sim$200,000 light-year) linear feature extending from a galaxy at $z\approx 0.96$. JWST spectroscopy reveals a sharp line-of-sight velocity discontinuity at the feature's tip, consistent with a supersonic perturber ($\sim 10^3$ km/s). Standard Rankine–Hugoniot conditions mandate post-shock temperatures of $T \sim 1.4 \times 10^7$ K for a $v \approx 1000$ km/s driver. The cooling timescale at this temperature exceeds the dynamical expansion time by a factor of 20, creating a cooling bottleneck ($t_{\rm cool} \gg t_{\rm dyn}$) that poses a strong challenge for prompt condensation under a simple single-phase thermal-shock picture. This tension motivates considering a non-thermal driver.</p>

    <p>An alternative interpretation is proposed in which the dominant driver is metric rather than hydrodynamic: RBH-1 is modeled as a macroscopic gravitational soliton—a coherent, propagating region with an altered proper-time rate, arising from the conformal time-field sector of the Temporal Equivalence Principle (TEP). In this picture, the observed discontinuity corresponds to a spatial gradient in gravitational redshift (a metric shock). The effective collapse threshold is reduced behind the front, enabling star formation without a prolonged hot phase.</p>

    <p>A scalar-field soliton model is tested, constrained by a single density parameter $\rho_c \approx 20 \text{ g/cm}^3$ calibrated from terrestrial atomic clock coherence limits. This terrestrial calibration predicts the $10^7 M_{\odot}$ crossover scale of RBH-1 consistent at the percent level within observational mass uncertainty, and predicts the Milky Way's Keplerian transition radius ($\sim$19 kpc, Gaia DR3) consistent at the few-percent level within systematic uncertainty in the adopted transition definition. Application to the SPARC galaxy database confirms the same scaling for the onset of dark matter dominance, yielding a threshold-marginalized exponent $\alpha = 0.354 \pm 0.014$, consistent with the TEP prediction of $1/3$.</p>

    <p>A comprehensive Vainshtein screening analysis across 26 astrophysical objects spanning 15 orders of magnitude in density reveals an empirical scaling law $S \propto \rho^{0.334}$ ($R^2 = 0.9999$), further confirming the universality of the $M^{1/3}$ relation. This screening hierarchy explains why precision GR tests (e.g., binary pulsars) show no scalar deviation: at nuclear densities, screening factors exceed 30,000×, suppressing scalar contributions below measurement precision.</p>

    <p>Additional discriminators for horizonless compact objects using VLBI polarimetry are discussed as future work. Robust inference is contingent on forward modeling and comparison to GRMHD null ensembles processed through the same synthetic-observation and imaging pipeline.</p>
