<h1>1. Introduction: The RBH-1 Anomaly</h1>

<p>In December 2025, JWST spectroscopy confirmed the existence of the first candidate runaway supermassive black hole. Designated RBH-1, this object has an inferred mass of approximately $10^7 M_\odot$ and a proper motion of $v_{\bullet} = 954^{+110}_{-126}$ km/s, leaving behind a 62 kpc linear feature of active star formation. The discovery is consistent with theoretical predictions that supermassive black holes can be ejected from their host galaxies via gravitational wave recoil following a black hole merger (van Dokkum et al. 2025; Campanelli et al. 2007).</p>

<p>At $z \approx 0.96$, RBH-1 appears as a luminous streak extending from a galaxy in the constellation Sextans. A bow-shaped interaction region marks its leading edge, while the wake exhibits active star formation along its entire extent.</p>

<h2>The Scientific Puzzle</h2>
<p>
    While the confirmation of RBH-1 as a runaway black hole is itself remarkable, the object presents a deeper observational anomaly. It appears as a linear streak of light extending 62 kpc ($\sim$200,000 light-years) from a distant galaxy ($z\approx 0.96$). At its tip lies a bright, bow-shaped interaction region where JWST spectroscopy reveals a sharp kinematic discontinuity: a line-of-sight velocity change of order $\sim 600$–$650$ km/s across $\sim$1 kpc (van Dokkum et al. 2023; van Dokkum et al. 2025). This structure, which lacks the expected thermal broadening of a high-Mach shock, is illustrated in Figure 1 (see Section 5).
</p>

<p>
    In a purely hydrodynamic picture, a compact perturber moving at $v \sim 10^3$ km/s through circumgalactic gas would be expected to drive a strong bow shock and turbulent wake, producing post-shock temperatures of order $10^7$ K and associated hot-phase emission. RBH-1 instead exhibits a narrow, structurally coherent wake whose line diagnostics are consistent with gas cool enough to support ongoing star formation.

</div>

<p>
    Taken together, the kinematics and thermodynamic diagnostics suggest a large perturbation with limited thermalization. The following sections frame this tension through two related problems: the Temperature Paradox and the Geometry Problem.
</p>

<h2>The Temperature Paradox</h2>
<p>
    A bow shock at $v_s \sim 10^3$ km/s corresponds to Mach numbers $\mathcal{M} \gg 1$ in typical circumgalactic conditions. Standard Rankine–Hugoniot jump conditions mandate substantial conversion of bulk kinetic energy into thermal energy. For $v_s \approx 1000$ km/s, the characteristic post-shock temperature is:
</p>
<div>
    $$ T_s \approx \frac{3}{16k_B} \mu m_p v_s^2 \approx 1.4 \times 10^7 \text{ K} $$
</div>
<p>
    At this temperature, thermal pressure strongly suppresses gravitational collapse. Since the Jeans mass scales as $M_J \propto T^{3/2}$, raising the temperature from $100$ K to $10^7$ K increases the characteristic collapse mass scale by a factor of $10^{7.5}$ ($\sim 3\times 10^7$), making in-situ star formation in recently shocked gas difficult without highly efficient cooling.
</p>

<h3>The Cooling Bottleneck ($t_{\mathrm{cool}} \gg t_{\mathrm{dyn}}$)</h3>
<p>
    A common counter-argument involves rapid radiative cooling, potentially aided by turbulent mixing or thermal instabilities (e.g., Gronke &amp; Oh 2018). The viability of this resolution depends on density, metallicity, and mixing. A fiducial calculation is presented below to frame the magnitude of the cooling constraint under standard optically thin assumptions.
</p>

<h4>Bremsstrahlung Cooling Time</h4>
<p>
    The thermal energy density of a fully ionized plasma is $E = (3/2) n k_B T$, and the radiative cooling rate per volume is $\dot{E} = n^2 \Lambda(T)$, where $\Lambda(T)$ is the cooling function. At $T \sim 10^7$ K, cooling is dominated by free-free (Bremsstrahlung) emission with contributions from metal-line cooling, yielding $\Lambda(T) \approx 2.5 \times 10^{-23}$ erg cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ for solar metallicity (Sutherland &amp; Dopita 1993). The cooling time is:
</p>
<div>
    $$ t_{\mathrm{cool}} = \frac{E}{\dot{E}} = \frac{3 k_B T}{2 n \Lambda(T)} $$
</div>
<p>
    Substituting the post-shock temperature $T = 1.4 \times 10^7$ K and a post-shock density $n = 0.1$ cm$^{-3}$ (compressed/clumpy phase, distinct from the ambient CGM mean $n_{\rm CGM} \sim 10^{-3}$ cm$^{-3}$; note that $t_{\rm cool} \propto 1/n$, so lower densities yield even longer cooling times):
</p>
<div>
    $$ t_{\mathrm{cool}} = \frac{3 \times (1.38 \times 10^{-16}\,\mathrm{erg\,K^{-1}}) \times (1.4 \times 10^7\,\mathrm{K})}{2 \times (0.1\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}) \times (2.5 \times 10^{-23}\,\mathrm{erg\,cm^3\,s^{-1}})} \approx 36\,\mathrm{Myr} $$
</div>

<h4>Dynamical Timescale</h4>
<p>
    The relevant comparison timescale is the sound-crossing time of the wake. The post-shock sound speed for a fully ionized plasma ($\gamma = 5/3$, mean molecular weight $\mu = 0.6$) at $T = 1.4 \times 10^7$ K is:
</p>
<div>
    $$ c_s = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma k_B T}{\mu m_p}} \approx 560\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}} $$
</div>
<p>
    For the observed wake width $w \approx 1$ kpc (van Dokkum et al. 2025), the dynamical timescale is:
</p>
<div>
    $$ t_{\mathrm{dyn}} = \frac{w}{c_s} \approx 1.7\,\mathrm{Myr} $$
</div>

<h4>The Critical Inequality</h4>
<p>
    Comparing these timescales yields the fundamental constraint:
</p>
<div>
    $$ \frac{t_{\mathrm{cool}}}{t_{\mathrm{dyn}}} = \frac{36\,\mathrm{Myr}}{1.7\,\mathrm{Myr}} \approx 20 $$
</div>
<div class="result-box">
    $$ t_{\mathrm{cool}} \gg t_{\mathrm{dyn}} \quad (\text{by a factor of } \sim 20) $$
</div>
<p>
    This inequality is robust across the plausible parameter space. Sensitivity analysis shows that only at densities $n \gtrsim 1$ cm$^{-3}$ (an order of magnitude higher than typical circumgalactic values) does the ratio approach unity. For fiducial parameters, shock-heated gas at $10^7$ K would expand and rarefy long before radiating sufficient energy to reach star-forming temperatures ($T \lesssim 10^4$ K).
</p>
<p>
    Yet the RBH-1 wake exhibits active star formation immediately behind the apex. The coexistence of a large kinematic discontinuity and weak thermalization creates a cooling bottleneck ($t_{\mathrm{cool}} \gg t_{\mathrm{dyn}}$) that places a simple single-phase thermal-shock interpretation under tension. This motivates considering a non-thermal contribution. It is proposed that the observed velocity discontinuity ($\sim 650$ km/s) may reflect a coherent redshift gradient—a metric shock—in which the velocity jump is an apparent effect of differential proper time rather than bulk thermalization.
</p>

<h2>The Geometry Problem</h2>
<p>
    The wake's geometry is also nontrivial. Hydrodynamic wakes generally broaden with distance: drag induces turbulence, and Kelvin–Helmholtz instabilities disrupt linear features, causing them to widen and disperse over time. Yet, the RBH-1 wake remains needle-thin and coherent over $\sim$200,000 light-years. It does not broaden as a typical turbulent wake; it remains exceptionally collimated.
</p>

<p>
    This linearity has motivated alternative interpretations, including the possibility that the feature is a thin, edge-on galaxy (Sanchez Almeida et al. 2023). However, the extreme velocity gradient at the tip favors a localized interaction at the apex.
</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Scope of this manuscript:</strong> The coexistence of a large kinematic discontinuity and weak thermalization creates a cooling bottleneck ($t_{\mathrm{cool}} \gg t_{\mathrm{dyn}}$) that places a simple single-phase hydrodynamic bow-shock interpretation under tension. This motivates considering a non-thermal contribution to the observed discontinuity. It is proposed that the observed discontinuity may be primarily metric rather than hydrodynamic. Within the Temporal Equivalence Principle (TEP) framework, matter couples to a distinct metric $\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}$ related to the gravitational metric by a conformal factor $A(\phi)$. This manuscript tests the hypothesis that RBH-1 can be modeled as a gravitational soliton—a propagating region of altered proper-time rate in the conformal sector. The central question is whether a metric-based driver can reproduce the kinematics while avoiding strong thermal signatures, thereby addressing both the temperature and geometry tensions.</p>
</div>

<p>
    The following analysis reduces the problem to its fundamental components, proposing a minimal reinterpretation: testing whether the saturation density $\rho_c$ constrained by terrestrial atomic clocks also governs the structure of a $10^7 M_\odot$ cosmic giant.
