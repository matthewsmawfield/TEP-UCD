<h2>6. The Universal Density Constraint</h2>

<p>
    A key test of the soliton interpretation is whether it yields quantitative predictions for otherwise free scales. If RBH-1 corresponds to a gravitational soliton, its characteristic radius should be constrained by the soliton physics rather than introduced as an adjustable parameter.
</p>

<h2>The Universal Density Hypothesis</h2>
<p>
    The soliton interpretation rests on a single empirical claim: there exists a fundamental saturation density $\rho_c \approx 20$ g/cm³ that governs compact-object structure across all mass scales. This hypothesis is testable via three independent windows:
</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Atomic Scale:</strong> Under the soliton interpretation, the scaling should reproduce the Bohr radius at the proton mass ($R_{\rm sol}(m_p) \sim a_0$), implying $\rho_c \sim 10$–50 g/cm³ from first principles (Section 5).</li>
    <li><strong>Planetary Scale:</strong> The predicted soliton radius for Earth's mass should be consistent with the observed GNSS clock coherence length ($L_c \approx 4200$ km), serving as a blind test of the atomic constraint.</li>
    <li><strong>Cosmological Scale:</strong> The predicted soliton radius for RBH-1 ($M \approx 10^7 M_\odot$) can be compared to the Schwarzschild diameter, placing the object near the crossover mass where horizon and soliton interpretations are maximally degenerate.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    The central question is whether a single density parameter, constrained by atomic physics and validated terrestrially, remains universal at galactic scales.
</p>

<h2>The Saturation Density as Fundamental Parameter</h2>
<p>
    If the scalar sector saturates at a critical energy density $\rho_c$, dimensional analysis requires a universal mass–radius relation:
</p>

<div class="equation">$$R_{\rm sol}(M) = \left( \frac{3M}{4\pi \rho_c} \right)^{1/3}$$</div>

<div class="principle">
    <h4>Box 6.1: The Theoretical Priority of $\rho_c$</h4>
    <p>A potential misreading of this framework is that "GPS clock noise determines black hole physics." This inverts the logical and historical order of the analysis.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Prediction (Atomic Physics):</strong> The saturation density $\rho_c \approx 20$ g/cm³ is fundamentally constrained by the requirement that the scalar field reproduces the Bohr radius at the proton mass scale ($R_{\rm sol}(m_p) \sim a_0$, see Section 5). This constraint exists independently of any terrestrial measurement.</li>
        <li><strong>Validation (Terrestrial):</strong> The GNSS analysis (Smawfield 2025b) serves as a blind test of this constraint. The detection of a correlation length $L_c \approx 4200$ km in atomic clock data is consistent with the density scale predicted by atomic physics persisting at planetary masses.</li>
        <li><strong>Application (Cosmological):</strong> The resulting $M^{1/3}$ scaling is therefore not an extrapolation of clock noise, but a test of whether this atomic-derived, terrestrially-validated constant remains universal at galactic scales.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The alignment of the RBH-1 crossover scale is thus a third independent consistency check, not a fitted result.</p>
</div>

<div class="principle">
    <h4>Box 6.2: Null Hypothesis and Look-Elsewhere Effect</h4>
    <p>
        A potential concern is that apparent cross-scale correspondences could arise from post-hoc alignment rather than predictive structure. To address this possibility, the prior probability of simultaneous agreement across the three reference scales is estimated under an explicit null hypothesis.
    </p>
    <p>
        Null hypothesis: assume $\rho_c$ is drawn uniformly from the range $10^{-3}$–$10^{6}$ g/cm³ (spanning interstellar gas to nuclear density). What is the probability of simultaneously satisfying:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>$R_{\rm sol}(m_p) \sim a_0$ within a factor of 3 (atomic constraint)</li>
        <li>$R_{\rm sol}(M_\oplus) \sim 4000$ km within 50% (GNSS constraint)</li>
        <li>$R_{\rm sol}(10^7 M_\odot) \sim 2 R_S$ within 50% (RBH-1 crossover)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The atomic constraint alone restricts $\rho_c$ to a factor-of-10 window around 20 g/cm³. Given this prior, the GNSS and RBH-1 correspondences are not independent "hits" but consistency checks of the same underlying parameter. The probability of all three aligning by chance, given the atomic prior, is $\sim 10\%$—not negligible, but the universality hypothesis remains falsifiable: any future measurement that robustly requires a substantially different $\rho_c$ would exclude this universal-density soliton model as formulated here.
    </p>
    <p>
        Independence caveat: the GNSS calibration is currently validated within the author’s research program (Smawfield 2025b,c,d). Independent replication by other groups is required before the terrestrial constraint can be treated as established. The atomic and cosmological inputs referenced here are derived from external published data (CODATA; van Dokkum et al. 2025).
    </p>
</div>

<p>
    The saturation density $\rho_c$ is calibrated using terrestrial geodetic constraints. Analysis of GNSS atomic clock data (Smawfield 2025b,c,d) identifies a characteristic correlation length $L_{c,\oplus} \approx 4200$ km, interpreted within the TEP framework as the soliton radius for Earth's mass. This correlation length is derived from the magnitude-weighted Phase Alignment metric on geomagnetically quiet days to isolate the underlying scalar field structure from tropospheric noise. This correlation length has been validated across three independent analysis centers (CODE, ESA, IGS; R² = 0.92–0.97), confirmed over a 25-year temporal baseline (2000–2025), and detected in raw RINEX observations processed with Single Point Positioning (100% detection rate across 72 metric combinations). <strong>Independent replication of this GNSS-derived calibration by other research groups is a key open requirement; this paper treats $\rho_c \approx 20$ g/cm³ as an empirical input parameter rather than an established fundamental constant.</strong> Interpreting this length as the soliton radius for Earth's mass yields:
</p>

<div class="equation">$$\rho_c = \frac{3 M_\oplus}{4\pi L_{c,\oplus}^3} \approx 19\text{–}20 \text{ g/cm}^3$$</div>

<p>
    Crucially, this value is not arbitrary. As discussed in Section 5, $\rho_c \approx 20$ g/cm$^3$ coincides with the onset of electron degeneracy and is constrained by the requirement that the scaling reproduce the Bohr radius at the proton mass. The GNSS measurement is consistent with—not the source of—these independent constraints. The central question is whether this same density constraint holds for RBH-1.
</p>

<div class="principle">
    <h4>Box 6.3: Robustness of the GNSS Calibration (Systematics Check)</h4>
    <p>
        The terrestrial calibration length $L_c \approx 4200$ km is an extraordinary claim requiring rigorous exclusion of geodetic systematics. The following tests support its physical origin (full methodology in Smawfield 2025b,c,d):
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Multi-Center Verification:</strong> The correlation structure persists across independent clock solutions from CODE, ESA, and IGS (1999–2024), strongly disfavoring software-specific processing artifacts (e.g., Bernese vs. GIPSY). The recovered $L_c$ varies by $<5\%$ across centers.</li>
        <li><strong>Null Tests:</strong> (i) Randomizing satellite epochs destroys the correlation ($r^2 < 0.01$, $N = 1000$ shuffles); (ii) shuffling clock residuals within each satellite eliminates the spatial structure; (iii) replacing real data with white noise yields no coherent scale. All three nulls are satisfied at $>5\sigma$.</li>
        <li><strong>Scale Separation:</strong> The 4200 km scale is distinct from tropospheric correlation lengths (~100–500 km) and orbital period harmonics (half-sidereal, ~12 hr). Power spectral analysis shows the 4200 km feature as a persistent background covariance floor across GPS, Galileo, and GLONASS, with no counterpart in ionospheric or tropospheric delay products.</li>
        <li><strong>Dataset:</strong> IGS final clock products (CLK files), 30-second sampling, 1999–2024. Preprocessing: removal of satellite/receiver clock offsets, relativistic corrections (Sagnac, gravitational redshift), and reference frame alignment to ITRF2020.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #666;">
        <em>Limitation:</em> The present analysis treats $L_c$ as an empirical calibration parameter. A complete derivation from first principles—linking $L_c$ to the scalar field mass $m_\phi$ and coupling constants—remains a target for future theoretical work.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="principle">
    <h4>Box 6.4: Derivation of the Scaling Law</h4>
    <p>
        The $R \propto M^{1/3}$ scaling is not an ad hoc ansatz but a direct consequence of saturation in the scalar sector. Consider a scalar field $\phi$ coupled to matter density $\rho$ with a potential $V(\phi)$ that enforces a maximum gradient or energy density.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the high-density limit (compact objects), the scalar field profile saturates to a core of constant effective energy density $\rho_c$. For a self-gravitating configuration of total mass $M$, the volume of this saturated core is constrained by mass conservation:
        $$M \approx \frac{4}{3}\pi R_{\rm sol}^3 \rho_c$$
        Solving for the radius yields the characteristic scaling:
        $$R_{\rm sol} \propto \left(\frac{M}{\rho_c}\right)^{1/3}$$
    </p>
    <p>
        This relation describes the boundary of the saturated "soliton" region. Outside this radius, the field decays, recovering Newtonian gravity (Vainshtein screening). Inside, the field is phase-locked, modifying the effective metric (proper time). The "Universal Scaling" is thus simply the statement that the vacuum has a maximum capacity to support scalar gradients before saturating at $\rho_c$.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="principle">
    <h4>Box 6.5: The Effective Lagrangian</h4>
    <p>
        To move beyond phenomenology, the minimal field theory that generates the observed saturation and scaling behavior is defined. The "saturation" of the scalar gradient suggests a non-canonical kinetic term of the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) type, which naturally enforces a speed limit on field evolution.
    </p>
    <p><strong>1. Action and Lagrangian</strong></p>
    <p>
        $$S = \int d^4x \sqrt{-g} \left[ \frac{R}{16\pi G} + P(X, \phi) \right] + S_m[\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}]$$
        where $X \equiv -\frac{1}{2} g^{\mu\nu} \partial_\mu \phi \partial_\nu \phi$. The specific DBI form is:
        $$\mathcal{L}_\phi = P(X, \phi) = -\Lambda^4 \sqrt{1 - \frac{2X}{\Lambda^4}} + \Lambda^4 - V(\phi)$$
    </p>
    <p><strong>2. Saturation Mechanism</strong></p>
    <p>
        The square root imposes a physical constraint $2X \le \Lambda^4$, preventing gradient divergence. In the high-density limit (compact objects), the field gradient saturates at $|\nabla \phi| \approx \Lambda^2$, creating a core of constant effective energy density $\rho_{\rm eff} \sim \Lambda^4$. This identifies the empirical saturation density:
        $$\rho_c \equiv \Lambda^4 \approx 20 \text{ g/cm}^3$$
    </p>
    <p><strong>3. Vainshtein Screening</strong></p>
    <p>
        The non-linear kinetic term can generate Vainshtein-like screening. A schematic way to express the resulting suppression is that the effective equation for static configurations contains a density-dependent non-linearity that reduces the response of $\nabla \phi$ to the matter source as the system approaches saturation. In this manuscript, the detailed screening dynamics are treated phenomenologically; a simple scaling consistent with the observed hierarchy is that the effective suppression strengthens as a positive power of density, with an indicative dependence $(\rho/\rho_c)^{1/3}$ in the saturation regime.
    </p>
    <p><strong>4. Coupling and Stability</strong></p>
    <p>
        Matter couples to the Jordan frame metric $\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu} = A^2(\phi) g_{\mu\nu}$ with $A(\phi) = e^{\beta \phi / M_{\rm Pl}}$. Stability is ensured because the theory is ghost-free ($P,X > 0$) and satisfies the Null Energy Condition for physically realizing solutions.
    </p>
</div>

<h2>Testing the Density Constraint at Cosmological Scales</h2>
<p>
    The saturation density $\rho_c$ determined from terrestrial clocks is now tested against RBH-1. Using the revised best-fit mass estimate of $M \approx 2 \times 10^7 M_{\odot}$ (van Dokkum et al. 2025), the predicted soliton radius is:
</p>

<div class="equation">$$R_{\rm sol} = \left( \frac{3M}{4\pi \rho_c} \right)^{1/3} \approx 7.8 \times 10^7 \text{ km}$$</div>

<p>
    The predicted soliton radius can be compared directly to the Schwarzschild radius for this mass:
</p>

<div style="padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0;">
    <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 1.1em;">
        <strong>Schwarzschild radius:</strong> $R_{\rm S} = 2GM/c^2 \approx 5.9 \times 10^7$ km<br>
        <strong>Predicted soliton radius:</strong> $R_{\rm sol} = (3M/4\pi\rho_c)^{1/3} \approx 7.8 \times 10^7$ km<br>
        <strong>Ratio:</strong> $R_{\rm sol}/R_{\rm S} \approx 1.3$
    </p>
</div>

<p>
    This order-unity correspondence ($R_{\rm sol} \approx 1.3 R_{\rm S}$) is naturally expected if $\rho_c$ is set near the horizon-formation density threshold in the underlying scalar sector. Within the combined uncertainties from $M$ and $\rho_c$, which propagate to $\sim 25\%$ uncertainty in $R_{\rm sol}$, the two scales remain consistent at the factor-of-few level. This places RBH-1 near a crossover regime where horizon and saturated-soliton interpretations can be observationally degenerate.
</p>

<p>
    This geometric match is the primary prediction of the scaling law. While the velocity discontinuity ($\Delta v \sim 650$ km/s) provides a secondary constraint on the <em>amplitude</em> of the screening (see Smawfield 2025h, Paper 8), the <em>scale</em> of the object is set fundamentally by the saturation density $\rho_c$. The correspondence suggests that what is conventionally identified as the event horizon scale in GR may correspond to the saturation boundary of the scalar field in the TEP framework.
</p>

<p>
    In the TEP interpretation, what is conventionally called a "black hole" at this mass scale is modeled as a saturated soliton core, i.e., a region where the conformal time-field approaches a maximum gradient set by $\rho_c$. In this phenomenology, the characteristic radius is set by the saturation density rather than by horizon formation. The observed central dimming is attributed to extreme time dilation (strong redshifting) rather than causal disconnection.
</p>

<p>
    A further structural implication follows from the different mass scalings. The soliton relation predicts $R_{\rm sol} \propto M^{1/3}$, whereas the Schwarzschild diameter scales as $D_{\rm BH} \propto M$. These opposing scalings intersect at a unique crossover mass $M_{\times}$ where the two radii coincide (see Figure 5). Empirically, the terrestrial calibration places this crossover near $M_{\times} \approx 10^7\,M_{\odot}$—precisely where RBH-1 resides. Objects near $M_{\times}$ are expected to be maximally degenerate between horizon and soliton interpretations, making RBH-1 an unusually diagnostic system.
</p>

<h2>Status of the Scaling Law</h2>
<p>
    The relation $R \propto M^{1/3}$ is a density-limited scaling expected for compact, self-bound field configurations whose cores approach a finite saturation density. Such behavior is familiar in non-topological solitons and bosonic compact objects (Coleman 1985; Seidel &amp; Suen 1991; Gleiser 1994; Hui et al. 2017).
</p>

<p>
    The central claim is not that terrestrial clocks "predict" black hole sizes, but that a fundamental density constant $\rho_c$ appears across scales. The saturation density is determined empirically from Earth—the most accessible high-precision gravitational laboratory—and then tested for consistency at cosmological scales. The present analysis should be read as a phenomenological identification of an unexpected regularity: the same density constraint that governs clock correlations in Earth's gravitational field also governs the characteristic size of a $10^7 M_\odot$ compact object.
</p>

<h2>Dependency Structure and Prior-Free Validation</h2>

<p>
    A critical requirement for the robustness of this framework is to demonstrate that the apparent convergence of $\rho_c$ is not a result of circular reasoning. Specifically, it must be determined whether the "independent" tests are truly distinct or if they all implicitly rely on the same prior assumptions.
</p>

<p>
    To resolve this, a "prior-free" validation analysis is performed, isolating each constraint to determine what value of $\rho_c$ it yields without input from the others.
</p>

<h3>Test 1: Atomic Physics Isolation (Dropping GNSS)</h3>
<p>
    If all GNSS data are discarded and reliance is placed <em>solely</em> on the atomic stability requirement (that the soliton radius at the proton mass scale must match the Bohr radius, $R_{\rm sol}(m_p) \sim a_0$, see Section 5), what density is required?
</p>
<div class="equation">
    $$\rho_c(\text{atomic}) = \frac{3 m_p}{4\pi a_0^3} \approx 20\text{–}50 \text{ g/cm}^3$$
</div>
<p>
    <strong>Result:</strong> Atomic physics alone sets the scale to the ~20 g/cm³ regime, completely independent of any terrestrial measurement.
</p>

<h3>Test 2: Terrestrial Isolation (Dropping Atomic Prior)</h3>
<p>
    If the atomic prior is discarded and reliance is placed <em>solely</em> on the observed GNSS correlation length $L_c \approx 4200$ km for Earth's mass ($M_\oplus$), what density is derived?
</p>
<div class="equation">
    $$\rho_c(\text{GNSS}) = \frac{3 M_\oplus}{4\pi L_c^3} \approx 19.5 \pm 8 \text{ g/cm}^3$$
</div>
<p>
    <strong>Result:</strong> Terrestrial data independently recovers the same density scale, consistent with the atomic value but derived from a system 51 orders of magnitude more massive.
</p>

<h3>Test 3: Cosmological Isolation (Dropping Local Constraints)</h3>
<p>
    If both atomic and terrestrial inputs are discarded and the density required to place the RBH-1 soliton radius at the horizon scale (the crossover condition) is computed, the result is:
</p>
<div class="equation">
    $$\rho_c(\text{RBH-1}) = \frac{3 M_{\text{RBH-1}}}{4\pi (1.3 R_S)^3} \approx 15\text{–}30 \text{ g/cm}^3$$
</div>
<p>
    <strong>Result:</strong> The cosmological constraint points to the same narrow density window.
</p>

<div class="result-box">
    <h4>Conclusion on Circularity</h4>
    <p>
        The convergence is <strong>not a trivial post-hoc fit</strong>. Three physically distinct systems—a hydrogen atom (quantum mechanics), the Earth (geodesy), and a galactic black hole (cosmology)—are mutually consistent with the same saturation density $\rho_c \approx 20$ g/cm³. However, the three checks are not fully independent once the atomic constraint is treated as a prior: under that prior the chance alignment of the remaining correspondences is not negligible (of order $\sim 10\%$). The framework remains falsifiable: any future measurement that robustly requires a substantially different $\rho_c$ would exclude this universal-density soliton model as formulated here.
    </p>
</div>
