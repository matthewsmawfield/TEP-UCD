<h1>2. Theoretical Framework: The Gravitational Soliton</h1>

<p>
    It is proposed that the driver of the RBH-1 wake is not a ballistic projectile, but a propagating structure in the metric itself—specifically, a coherent excitation in the conformal time-field sector of the Temporal Equivalence Principle (TEP). Consider a region of deep gravitational potential—a gravitational soliton—moving through the cosmos (consistent with non-topological soliton solutions; see Kusenko 1997). As this structure traverses a gas cloud, it does not displace atoms kinetically; instead, it dilates time.
</p>

<h2>Phenomenology of the Time Lens</h2>
<p>
    In this framework, RBH-1 acts as a moving "time lens" or a "wall of slow time". Inside the soliton, time flows slower relative to the cosmic background ($d\tau < dt$). This creates a refractive effect. Just as glass bends light because light moves slower within it, a region of time dilation bends the trajectories of matter. To an external observer, gas entering this region appears to redshift and change velocity, not because it has been kicked, but because the local clock rate has changed.
</p>

<p>
    The soliton is treated here as an effective phenomenological description—a macroscopic "texture" in spacetime arising from the bi-metric scalar-tensor structure of TEP. In this framework, the gravitational metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ governs curvature, while an effective matter metric $\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}$ (to which clocks and electromagnetism couple) encodes the local proper-time rate. The key is the phenomenology: a coherent, traveling packet of time dilation in the conformal sector.
</p>

<p>
    The metrics are related by a scalar time field $\phi$ (often via conformal/disformal relations), so that spatial gradients in $\phi$ appear as gradients in the local proper-time rate $d\tau/dt$ (Smawfield 2025a). In high-density environments, Vainshtein screening suppresses this sector, recovering GR to Solar-System precision (Vainshtein 1972). Crucially, gravitational-wave observations (GW170817) constrain only the disformal sector—the speed of gravitational waves is bounded to $|c_g - c| < 10^{-15}$ (Gong et al. 2018)—but the conformal sector remains observationally unconstrained. Because photons and gravitational waves traverse the same path, conformal time dilation is common-mode and cancels in differential measurements. The conformal sector, responsible for clock rates and the phenomenology here termed "phantom mass," is precisely the sector in which TEP operates.
</p>

<p>
    Long-lived, spatially localized packets in scalar field theories have been studied in several closely related forms, including non-topological solitons ("Q-balls"; Coleman 1985), localized oscillatory configurations ("oscillons"; Gleiser 1994), and self-gravitating bound states ("oscillatons"; Seidel &amp; Suen 1991). The present manuscript does not commit to a specific microphysical realization; rather, these results motivate the plausibility of coherence over large distances in a weakly dissipative field sector.

    <h4>Box 2.1: The Underlying Scalar-Tensor Lagrangian</h4>
    <p>
        To ensure the theoretical basis is well-defined, the Lagrangian governing the scalar sector is specified, consistent with the TEP theory framework (Smawfield 2025a). The action is formulated in the Einstein frame with a cubic Galileon kinetic term:
        $$ S = \int d^4x \sqrt{-g} \left[ \frac{M_{Pl}^2}{2} R - \frac{1}{2}(\partial \phi)^2 - \frac{1}{\Lambda^3}(\partial \phi)^2 \Box \phi - V(\phi) \right] + S_m[\psi, \tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}] $$
        where the matter metric is disformally coupled: $\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu} = A(\phi) g_{\mu\nu} + B(\phi) \partial_\mu \phi \partial_\nu \phi$.
    </p>
    <p>
        The cubic Galileon term $(\partial \phi)^2 \Box \phi$ generates derivative self-interactions that ensure two critical features:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Vainshtein Screening:</strong> Near massive objects, nonlinear kinetic terms dominate, suppressing the scalar force and recovering GR. The screening radius scales as $r_V \propto (GM/\Lambda^3)^{1/3} \propto M^{1/3}$ (Vainshtein 1972; Nicolis et al. 2009).</li>
        <li><strong>Soliton/Domain Structure:</strong> The non-linear kinetic structure supports coherent field configurations, allowing for the macroscopic "Time Star" phenomenology explored here.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        This framework preserves Solar System constraints while allowing order-unity metric perturbations on galactic scales.
    </p>

<h2>2b. Forward Model: From Field Gradient to Velocity Shift</h2>

<p>
    To move beyond qualitative description, the explicit mapping between the scalar field profile and the observed kinematic signatures is defined below. This "Forward Model" predicts how a metric soliton mimics a hydrodynamic shock.
</p>

<h3>The Metric Redshift Relation</h3>
<p>
    In the TEP framework, the effective matter metric $\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}$ is conformally related to the gravitational metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ by a scalar function $A(\phi)$. The proper time interval $d\tau$ for a comoving observer is related to the coordinate time $dt$ by:
    $$ d\tau = \sqrt{A(\phi)} dt $$
</p>
<p>
    An emitter located within the soliton (where the field value is $\phi$) emits photons with a proper frequency $\nu_0$. To an external observer at infinity (where $A(\phi_\infty) \to 1$), the received frequency $\nu_{\text{obs}}$ is redshifted solely by the change in the local clock rate:
    $$ 1 + z_{\text{metric}} = \frac{\nu_0}{\nu_{\text{obs}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{A(\phi)}} $$
</p>
<p>
    This produces an <em>apparent</em> Doppler shift. Even if the gas is static ($v_{\text{pec}} = 0$), an observer interprets the frequency shift as a line-of-sight velocity $v_{\text{app}}$:
    $$ v_{\text{app}} \approx c \cdot z_{\text{metric}} \approx c \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{A(\phi)}} - 1 \right) $$
</p>

<h3>Predicting the Velocity Discontinuity</h3>
<p>
    The "shock" observed at the RBH-1 tip corresponds to the steep gradient of $A(\phi)$ at the soliton boundary.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Input:</strong> A saturation density $\rho_c \approx 20$ g/cm$^3$ implies a maximum potential depth $\Phi_{\text{max}} \approx GM/R_{\text{sol}}$.</li>
    <li><strong>Mapping:</strong> The conformal factor scales as $A(\phi) \approx e^{2\Phi/c^2}$.</li>
    <li><strong>Output:</strong> Assuming the gas acts as tracer particles following geodesics of the effective metric $\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}$, the predicted maximum velocity jump is:
        $$ \Delta v_{\text{max}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R_{\text{sol}}}} $$
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    For $M = 1.1 \times 10^7 M_{\odot}$ and $R_{\text{sol}} \approx 6.5 \times 10^7$ km (derived from $\rho_c$), this yields $\Delta v_{\text{max}} \approx 670 \pm 50$ km/s (where the uncertainty reflects the $\pm 15\%$ range in $\rho_c$). This matches the observed $\sim 650$ km/s discontinuity (van Dokkum et al. 2025) without fitting parameters.
</p>

<h3>Predicting Line Widths (The Discriminator)</h3>
<p>
    The crucial distinction lies in the second moment of the line distribution (line width).
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Thermal Shock:</strong> The velocity jump comes from chaotic thermalization. The line width $\sigma$ is dominated by thermal broadening: $\sigma_{\text{th}} \propto v_{\text{shock}}$. For $v \sim 1000$ km/s, $\sigma \sim 100$ km/s.</li>
    <li><strong>Metric Shock:</strong> The velocity jump comes from a coherent potential gradient. The line width is dominated only by the gradient variation across the telescope beam width plus the intrinsic cold-gas thermal width:
        $$ \sigma_{\text{obs}}^2 = \sigma_{\text{th,cold}}^2 + \sigma_{\text{grad}}^2 + \sigma_{\text{inst}}^2 $$
        Since the gas remains cold ($T \sim 10^4$ K, $\sigma_{\text{th}} \sim 10$ km/s) and the gradient is coherent, the predicted line width is narrow ($\sigma \ll v_{\text{app}}$).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Prediction:</strong> The metric shock model predicts a large centroid shift ($\sim 600$ km/s) with a narrow line width ($\sim 30$ km/s). This signature—"Fast Shift, Cold Width"—is the specific fingerprint of a gravitational soliton.
</p>

<h2>Thermodynamics of a Metric Shock</h2>
<p>
    This shift from "kinetic push" to "metric distortion" solves the temperature problem. A standard shock heats gas because it transfers momentum chaotically (thermalization). A metric shock is orderly. It creates a steep gradient in gravitational redshift that mimics a velocity discontinuity, but without the catastrophic heating.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>External Appearance (The Illusion): To an observer, the gas appears to decelerate and redshift abruptly, creating the signature of a high-speed shock.</li>
    <li>Internal Reality (The Trigger): Internally, the gas feels a sudden change in the effective potential. This lowers the threshold for gravitational collapse. The standard Jeans Mass ($M_J \propto T^{3/2}\rho^{-1/2}$) is modified by the time dilation factor $\gamma = dt/d\tau$:
        $$M_J' \approx \frac{M_J}{\gamma^2}$$
        (where $\gamma > 1$ because time passes slower inside the deep potential than at infinity, ensuring $M_J' < M_J$). This effectively "squeezes" the gas into star formation without boiling it first.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    A brief scale check illustrates the magnitude of the effect: for a modest time-dilation factor $\gamma = 1.5$, the collapse threshold decreases by $\gamma^{-2} \approx 0.44$; for $\gamma = 3$, the reduction is $\gamma^{-2} \approx 0.11$. In other words, order-unity variations in clock rate correspond to order-unity reductions in the Jeans threshold. The astrophysical question is therefore shifted from explaining how gas remains cold after a Mach-scale shock, to constraining whether the required $\gamma$ is consistent with the observed velocity discontinuity and with independent limits on non-GR couplings.
</p>

<p>
    Crucially, this reinterprets the measured $\sim 600$ km/s velocity jump. It is not a bulk flow of hot plasma, but a <em>differential proper-time lag</em> across the soliton boundary. Furthermore, the observed speed of the object ($\sim 1000$ km/s) is interpreted not as a ballistic trajectory, but as the characteristic group velocity of the scalar wave packet, determined by the stiffness (Vainshtein screening scale) of the intergalactic vacuum.
</p>

<p>
    The Discriminator: How can these models be distinguished? Discrimination relies on line-width thermometry.
    <br>
    In a thermal shock, a large velocity change ($v$) implies a high temperature ($T \propto v^2$), which inevitably broadens spectral lines due to random thermal motion ($\sigma_v \propto \sqrt{T}$).
    <br>
    In a metric shock, the "velocity change" is a coherent redshift shift. The centroid of the emission line moves, but the line width remains narrow because the gas stays cold.
</p>

<div>
    <h2>The Solution to the Paradox</h2>
    <p>
        This mechanism explains the cold wake. Star formation occurs because the gas is not hot; it is merely ticking slower. The "shock" is a refractive boundary, not a collision. This is quantitatively supported by the cooling analysis (Section 1), which demonstrates that under fiducial CGM conditions and standard optically thin cooling, $t_{\mathrm{cool}} \gg t_{\mathrm{dyn}}$ by a factor of $\sim 20$. The data are difficult to reconcile with a purely collisional strong shock; the metric-shock alternative is therefore tested in the following sections.
    </p>
</div>

<p>
    While the model is qualitatively attractive, it requires quantitative verification. If RBH-1 is a soliton, it must have a specific size. The next section tests this by applying a mass-radius scaling law derived from a completely independent source: terrestrial clocks.
