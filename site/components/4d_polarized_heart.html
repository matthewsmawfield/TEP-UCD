    <h2>3d. Core Polarization Signature (The "Polarized Heart" Test)</h2>
    
    <div class="caveat">
    <p><em>Note: This test applies to nearby supermassive objects resolvable by VLBI (e.g., M87*, Sgr A*), not to RBH-1 directly. At z ≈ 0.96, RBH-1's angular size is far below EHT resolution. The test is included here as a general discriminator for the soliton hypothesis applicable to future observations of nearby candidates. Direct empirical tests specific to RBH-1 are presented in Section 3e.</em></p>
    </div>

    <p>A potential discriminator using Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI), targeting the polarization structure in the central brightness depression.</p>

    <p>
        The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) images "shadows" of supermassive objects (e.g., M87*), where the standard black hole model predicts a true silhouette: no light can originate from inside the ring due to horizon trapping, and polarization vectors must vanish or become incoherent in the dark center.
    </p>

    <p>
        In contrast, the gravitational soliton model predicts an object with no event horizon. The core is expected to be transparent or translucent to certain wavelengths. Consequently, a key discriminator is the polarization signature within the "shadow" region.
    </p>

    <p>
        This section is presented as a falsification-forward proposal rather than as a currently decisive test. Robust inference requires forward modeling (horizonless model → radiative transfer → synthetic observation → image reconstruction) and comparison to a GRMHD null ensemble processed through the same pipeline, to control for prior dependence, scattering, and calibration systematics.
    </p>

    <div class="principle">
    <h4>The Test: Core Fractional Polarization Within the Shadow Region</h4>
    <p>The observable is the fractional linear polarization $m = \sqrt{Q^2 + U^2}/I$ measured within the inner $0.5 R_{\rm shadow}$ region, after accounting for instrumental dynamic range, scattering, and image-reconstruction priors. In horizonless models with intrinsically emitting or scattering interiors, polarization may remain measurable deeper into the central region than in horizon-absorbing models. The magnitude of any contrast is model-dependent and must be assessed with synthetic observations and null tests.</p>
    </div>

    <p>
        This "Polarized Heart" signature arises because the soliton core, while deeply redshifted, remains topologically connected to the background spacetime, allowing magnetic field lines and polarized flux to thread the interior. Recent simulations of solitonic boson stars independently confirm this distinction: "Due to the absence of the event horizon in solitonic boson stars, polarization vectors can penetrate the interior of the star, whereas no polarization signals are observed within the event horizon of black holes" (arXiv:2508.11992, 2025). These simulations further identify anomalous electric vector position angle (EVPA) patterns at certain parameter combinations that do not occur in black hole systems, providing additional discriminating signatures for next-generation EHT observations.

    <h3>Quantitative Predictions</h3>

    <p>
        Concrete quantitative thresholds for this test depend on assumptions about electron thermodynamics, magnetic geometry, scattering, and the imaging pipeline. The table below summarizes the qualitative contrast expected between (i) horizon-absorbing models and (ii) horizonless models with an emitting or translucent interior.
    </p>

    <table class="data-table">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Metric</th>
        <th>Black Hole</th>
        <th>Soliton</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>Core Fractional Polarization (\(m_{\text{core}}\))</td>
        <td>Expected to be low or poorly constrained (core emission suppressed)</td>
        <td>May be non-zero if the interior contributes polarized flux</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Core-to-Ring Polarization Ratio</td>
        <td>0 (no core flux)</td>
        <td>Model-dependent (set by interior brightness and polarization fraction)</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>Detection of statistically significant polarized flux well inside the ring would motivate targeted comparison against horizonless models, but it is not, by itself, a unique indicator of any single microphysical interpretation.</p>

    <div class="finding">
    <p>Sensitivity modeling should be treated as indicative unless accompanied by end-to-end synthetic observations, including realistic uv-coverage, scattering, calibration systematics, and prior sensitivity studies.</p>

    <h3>Feasibility & Instrumental Constraints</h3>

    <div class="principle">
    <h4>Discovery Window</h4>
    <p>EHT imaging of M87* supports a central brightness depression with published limits at the \(\lesssim 10\%\) level. This provides meaningful constraints on models with appreciable core emission, while leaving a wide parameter space open for fainter or prior-sensitive core signals. Improved dynamic range, uv-coverage, and end-to-end synthetic-observation studies are required to turn this into a robust discriminator.</p>
    <p><em>If the soliton core is extremely dark (Regime III), it mimics a vacuum horizon to arbitrary precision. However, TEP suggests that the core is a region of saturated metric density, which likely couples to matter/fields at some non-zero level.</em></p>
