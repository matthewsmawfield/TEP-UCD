<h2>7. Compact Object Test: Magnetar Anti-Glitches</h2>

<h2>Predicted Critical Spin Period</h2>

<p>For compact objects at nuclear densities, the soliton radius becomes comparable to the stellar radius at a critical mass-dependent threshold. For a canonical neutron star mass $M \approx 1.4 M_\odot$ and $\rho_c \approx 20$ g/cm³, the soliton radius is:</p>

<div>
    $$ R_{\text{sol}} = \left( \frac{3M}{4\pi \rho_c} \right)^{1/3} \approx \left( \frac{3 \times 2.8 \times 10^{33}\,\text{g}}{4\pi \times 20\,\text{g/cm}^3} \right)^{1/3} \approx 2.4 \times 10^6\,\text{cm} \approx 24\,\text{km} $$
</div>

<p>For a typical neutron star radius $R_{\text{NS}} \approx 12$ km, the soliton radius exceeds the stellar radius by a factor of $\sim$2. This implies that slowly rotating neutron stars are embedded within their own scalar field envelopes.</p>

<p>As the star spins down, centrifugal support weakens and the corotation structure of the envelope changes. Near a critical spin period, the soliton can no longer maintain a quasi-stationary configuration around the rotating star, leading to a structural transition. In this phenomenology, such a transition can manifest as an "anti-glitch"—a sudden <em>decrease</em> in spin rate, opposite to the conventional glitches caused by superfluid vortex unpinning.</p>

<p>The critical period is estimated from the condition that the centrifugal radius equals the soliton radius:</p>

<div>
    $$ P_{\text{crit}} \approx 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{sol}}^3}{GM}} \approx 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{(2.4 \times 10^6\,\text{cm})^3}{6.67 \times 10^{-8}\,\text{cm}^3\,\text{g}^{-1}\,\text{s}^{-2} \times 2.8 \times 10^{33}\,\text{g}}} \approx 6.8\,\text{s} $$
</div>

<h2>Observational Test: 1E 2259+586</h2>

<p>The magnetar 1E 2259+586 has a spin period $P = 6.98$ s (Archibald et al. 2013). This object exhibits anomalous timing behavior, including anti-glitches—sudden decreases in rotation rate inconsistent with standard pulsar spin-down models.</p>

<p>The agreement between the predicted critical period ($P_{\text{crit}} \approx 6.8$ s) and the observed period of 1E 2259+586 ($P = 6.98$ s) is within 4%. This proximity is noteworthy given the 14-order-of-magnitude extrapolation from GNSS calibration, though statistical significance is limited by the single-object sample. The match suggests consistency of the $\rho_c$ scale across density regimes, but should be interpreted as a scale-consistency check rather than a definitive validation.</p>

<h2>Physical Interpretation</h2>

<p>In the TEP framework, magnetar anti-glitches can be interpreted as candidate soliton destabilization events. As the star spins down through $P_{\text{crit}}$, the scalar field envelope may undergo a structural transition, producing an impulsive change in the external torque and/or exchanging angular momentum with the star through the magnetosphere–envelope coupling. This interpretation is distinct from conventional glitches (vortex unpinning) and is presented as a hypothesis for the origin of anti-glitch events.</p>

<p>The critical period $P_{\text{crit}} \approx 6.8$ s provides a testable extrapolation of the GNSS-calibrated $\rho_c \approx 20$ g/cm³ to nuclear density scales ($\rho \sim 10^{14}$ g/cm³). The 4% agreement with 1E 2259+586 offers tentative support for this extrapolation, though future observations of additional magnetars will be needed to establish statistical significance.</p>

<h4>Dynamical Mechanism</h4>
<p>
    While the <strong>geometric</strong> match between $R_{\text{sol}}$ and $R_{\text{NS}}$ is precise (4%), a full dynamical description of the torque mechanism—how the scalar envelope extracts angular momentum from the neutron star—requires a specific coupling function $\Omega(\phi)$ not derived here. This coincidence is presented as a scale-consistency check rather than a complete dynamical model. The anti-glitch phenomenon may involve additional physics (magnetic field reconfiguration, crust fractures) that modulates the soliton transition.
</p>
</div>

<h2>Population-Level Predictions</h2>

<p>
    The detection of an anti-glitch in a single object (1E 2259+586), while compelling, is not statistically sufficient. To establish this mechanism, specific population-level predictions are stated that can be tested against future magnetar catalogs.
</p>

<div class="result-box">
    <h4>Prediction 1: The Critical Period Threshold</h4>
    <p>
        Anti-glitches are expected to preferentially occur near a critical period $P_{\text{crit}}$ determined by the object's mass and radius, if the proposed soliton destabilization channel operates. The condition $R_{\text{centrifugal}} = R_{\text{sol}}$ yields:
        $$ P_{\text{crit}}(M) \approx 6.8\,\text{s} \left( \frac{M}{1.4 M_\odot} \right)^{-1/2} $$
        <strong>Test:</strong> In a population of magnetars, anti-glitch events should cluster around this mass-dependent period line. Objects with $P \ll 6$ s (deeply screened) would be expected to be stable against this specific instability, though other mechanisms could still produce timing events.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="result-box">
    <h4>Prediction 2: Signatures of the Transition</h4>
    <p>
        Unlike crustal starquakes (which can occur at any period), soliton destabilization is a threshold phenomenon. The model predicts:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Unidirectionality:</strong> In this channel, the transition involves the shedding of the scalar envelope's angular momentum, favoring spin-down (anti-glitch) events or enhanced spin-down rates. Spin-up glitches are expected to remain dominated by standard vortex physics.</li>
        <li><strong>Period Clustering:</strong> As the magnetar population evolves, there could be an excess of objects exhibiting variability near the $P \approx 6$–8 s window as they cross the stability threshold, though other astrophysical effects may also contribute to period clustering.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h2>Alternative Magnetar Candidates</h2>

<p>Other slowly rotating magnetars near $P \sim 7$ s may exhibit similar behavior. Future timing campaigns targeting objects in the 6–8 s period range could test whether anti-glitch activity clusters near $P_{\text{crit}}$, providing additional constraints on the soliton model.</p>

<p>The magnetar test is particularly powerful because it probes the <em>high-density</em> regime where screening is strong ($S \gg 1$, see Section 4), yet the soliton radius is still large enough to affect stellar structure. This provides a crucial bridge between terrestrial calibration (Earth) and cosmological applications (galaxies).</p>
