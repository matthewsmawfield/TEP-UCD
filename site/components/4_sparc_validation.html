<h2>3. The SPARC Galaxy Analysis: Phantom Mass as Unscreened Time-Field</h2>

<p>
    Galaxies can be understood as "baryon-anchored" solitons—where the same scalar field structure calibrated from terrestrial GNSS data is pinned to a baryonic mass concentration. This section extends the test to galactic scales, where the $M^{1/3}$ scaling is expected to govern the transition between screened (Newtonian) and unscreened (phantom mass) regimes. The SPARC database provides an ideal testbed: 175 disk galaxies with high-quality rotation curves and well-constrained baryonic mass distributions. The theoretical basis for the phantom mass interpretation is developed in detail in Smawfield (2025e), which demonstrates how differential proper-time accumulation in gravitational lensing can produce apparent dark matter phenomenology.
</p>

<h2>Theoretical Expectation</h2>
<p>
    In the TEP framework, the apparent "dark matter" observed in galaxy rotation curves is identified as <em>Phantom Mass</em>—defined as the apparent mass derived from temporal shear under the assumption of isochrony (Smawfield 2025e). It is not a particle species but a geometric manifestation of the unscreened proper-time field. A critical distinction must be emphasized: "Phantom Mass" is an <em>observational inference artifact</em> (analogous to a refractive index effect), not a "ghost field" in the quantum field theory sense. Ghost fields imply negative kinetic energy and Hamiltonian instability; phantom mass carries no such pathology. It arises simply from modeling a bi-metric spacetime with a single-metric prior—the "missing mass" is the unmodeled temporal shear contribution.
</p>
<p>
    The transition radius $R_{\rm trans}$ marks the boundary between two regimes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Inside $R_{\rm trans}$: The local density exceeds the critical screening density ($\rho > \rho_{\rm trans}$). The time-field is screened, and gravity follows Newtonian predictions based on visible baryonic matter.</li>
    <li>Outside $R_{\rm trans}$: The density drops below $\rho_{\rm trans}$. The time-field becomes unscreened, and the refractive proper-time gradient produces an apparent gravitational excess—the "phantom mass" conventionally attributed to dark matter.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    If this interpretation is correct, the radius at which rotation curves diverge from Newtonian prediction should scale as $R_{\rm DM} \propto M_{\rm bar}^{1/3}$. While the fundamental core saturation occurs at $\rho_c \approx 20$ g/cm³, the halo transition is governed by a much lower density threshold $\rho_{\rm trans}$ characteristic of the diffuse field tail.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Invariant:</strong> $\rho_c$ denotes the universal saturation density of the scalar sector that fixes the compact soliton scale via $R_{\rm sol} \propto (M/\rho_c)^{1/3}$. By contrast, $\rho_{\rm trans}$ is an <em>emergent</em> screening threshold for the onset of halo phenomenology in diffuse environments; it is not treated as a second fundamental constant and can depend on coupling, geometry, and baryonic structure.
</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>
    The analysis proceeds as follows for each of the 175 SPARC galaxies:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Calculate the total baryonic mass: $M_{\rm bar} = M_* + 1.33 M_{\rm HI}$, where $M_* = (M/L)_{3.6\mu} \times L_{3.6}$ with $(M/L)_{3.6\mu} = 0.5\,M_\odot/L_\odot$ for disk populations.</li>
    <li>Compute the expected Newtonian rotation velocity: $V_{\rm bar}^2 = V_{\rm gas}^2 + (M/L)_{\rm disk} V_{\rm disk}^2 + (M/L)_{\rm bulge} V_{\rm bulge}^2$.</li>
    <li>Identify the mass discrepancy onset radius $R_{\rm DM}$: the first radius where $V_{\rm obs}/V_{\rm bar} > 1.3$.</li>
    <li>Fit the power-law relation $R_{\rm DM} = k \cdot M_{\rm bar}^\alpha$ across the full sample.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
    Of the 175 SPARC galaxies, 167 yield valid mass discrepancy onset radii spanning five decades in baryonic mass ($10^7$–$10^{12}\,M_\odot$).
</p>

<h3>Robustness to Onset Definition</h3>
<p>
    To address concerns that the "onset radius" is a noise-sensitive functional, a rigorous bootstrap analysis (1000 resamples) was performed across multiple definition criteria. The scaling exponent $\alpha$ remains consistent with the TEP prediction ($\alpha = 1/3$) across a wide range of velocity ratio thresholds:
</p>

</table>

<p>
    While individual definitions shift the normalization, the slope consistently clusters around the $M^{1/3}$ prediction. An alternative definition based on acceleration thresholds ($a < a_0$) yields a steeper slope ($\alpha \approx 0.5$), but this method is known to be degenerate with the MOND acceleration scale itself and is less direct than the kinematic divergence test.
</p>

<div class="result-box">
    $$R_{\rm DM} = k \cdot M_{\rm bar}^\alpha$$
    $$\alpha \approx 0.35 \pm 0.04 \text{ (Robust Estimate)}$$
</div>

<p>
    The marginalized exponent deviates from the TEP prediction of $\alpha = 1/3 = 0.333$ by approximately 1.0–1.5 standard deviations (depending on definition)—consistent within typical statistical tolerance. The correlation coefficient $r \approx 0.6$ indicates a highly significant relationship. Importantly, this result is robust: individual threshold choices yield exponents ranging from 0.28 to 0.42, but the ensemble average converges near 1/3.
</p>

<h3>Cross-Regime Consistency</h3>
<p>
    The significance of this result emerges when combined with the Vainshtein screening analysis (Section 4). The empirical screening law $S \propto \rho^{0.334}$ ($R^2 = 0.9999$) spans 15 orders of magnitude in density—from gas giants ($\rho \sim 1$ g/cm³) to binary pulsars ($\rho \sim 10^{14}$ g/cm³). The consistency of this exponent across such a range is suggestive, though the high $R^2$ is partly a consequence of the definitions used (see Box 4.1). The result is consistent with the hypothesis that the $M^{1/3}$ scaling reflects a genuine feature of the gravitational sector, though systematic uncertainties in rotation curve fitting and baryonic modeling remain.
</p>
<p>
    Combined with the SPARC galaxy scaling ($\alpha = 0.354 \pm 0.014$), the RBH-1 crossover consistency (within $\sim 25\%$ combined uncertainty), and the Milky Way Keplerian transition (few-percent level), these results suggest a universal density-limited structure may span 41 orders of magnitude in mass—from the proton to superclusters.
</p>

<h2>Physical Interpretation</h2>
<p>
    The observed $M^{1/3}$ scaling admits a natural interpretation in terms of density-limited screening. If the screening transition occurs at a characteristic density $\rho_{\rm trans}$, dimensional analysis requires:
</p>
<div>
    $$R_{\rm trans} \sim \left( \frac{M}{\rho_{\rm trans}} \right)^{1/3}$$
</div>
<p>
    Fixing $\alpha = 1/3$ and fitting only the normalization yields $k \approx 7.9 \times 10^{-4}\,{\rm kpc}/M_\odot^{1/3}$, corresponding to an effective screening density $\rho_{\rm trans} \approx 0.5\,M_\odot/{\rm pc}^3$ ($\sim 3 \times 10^{-23}$ g/cm³). This value is within an order of magnitude of typical disk densities at the optical radius (0.01–0.1 $M_\odot/{\rm pc}^3$), providing a physically reasonable anchor for the screening mechanism.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Note:</em> This galactic transition density $\rho_{\rm trans}$ is distinct from the fundamental core saturation density $\rho_c \approx 20$ g/cm³ derived in Section 5. The core density $\rho_c$ governs the compact object size (soliton surface), while $\rho_{\rm trans}$ governs the onset of the diffuse halo effect (screening radius). Both scales follow the same $M^{1/3}$ structural form, confirming the density-dependent nature of the theory across 40 orders of magnitude in density.
</p>

<h3>Connection to the MOND Acceleration Scale</h3>
<p>
    The fitted screening density implies a characteristic transition acceleration. At the transition radius, the gravitational acceleration is:
</p>
<div>
    $$g_{\rm TEP} = \frac{GM}{R_{\rm trans}^2} \approx 5 \times 10^{-10}\,{\rm m/s}^2$$
</div>
<p>
    This is within a factor of 4 of the MOND acceleration scale $a_0 \approx 1.2 \times 10^{-10}\,{\rm m/s}^2$. The near-coincidence suggests that the TEP screening mechanism and the empirical MOND phenomenology may share a common origin: both describe the transition from screened (Newtonian) to unscreened (modified) gravity at a characteristic acceleration scale set by cosmological boundary conditions.
</p>

<h2>Connection to the Radial Acceleration Relation</h2>
<p>
    The SPARC database is the source of the celebrated Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR), which shows a tight empirical coupling between observed acceleration $g_{\rm obs}$ and baryonic acceleration $g_{\rm bar}$ (McGaugh et al. 2016). The RAR has been interpreted as evidence for modified gravity (MOND) or as a consequence of dark matter halo profiles fine-tuned to baryonic distributions.
</p>
<p>
    The TEP framework offers a third interpretation: the RAR emerges naturally from the density-dependent screening of the proper-time field. At high accelerations (high densities), screening is complete and $g_{\rm obs} \approx g_{\rm bar}$. At low accelerations (low densities), the unscreened time-field gradient contributes additional apparent gravity, producing the characteristic upturn in the RAR. The $M^{1/3}$ scaling of the transition radius is the spatial manifestation of this acceleration-dependent screening.

<h2>Linking RBH-1 to Galactic Halos</h2>
<p>
    The SPARC analysis establishes a direct empirical connection between the RBH-1 wake phenomenon and galactic dark matter halos:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>RBH-1 represents a "naked soliton"—a gravitational soliton not anchored to a baryonic host, propagating freely through the intergalactic medium and inducing star formation via its time-dilation wake.</li>
    <li>Galactic halos represent "baryon-anchored solitons"—the same temporal field structure, but centered on and shaped by the baryonic mass distribution of the host galaxy.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Both phenomena obey the same $M^{1/3}$ scaling law, calibrated from terrestrial GNSS observations. The universality of this scaling across planetary, stellar, galactic, and cosmological mass scales constitutes a central prediction of the Temporal Equivalence Principle.
</p>

<h2>Residual Analysis: Discriminating Baryonic Feedback vs Field Theory</h2>
<p>
    The RMS scatter of 0.48 dex around the $M^{1/3}$ relation indicates substantial galaxy-to-galaxy variation. A critical test distinguishes whether this scatter arises from baryonic feedback processes (Standard Model) or from the intrinsic field theory mechanism (TEP): correlate the residuals with baryonic properties versus screening proxies.
</p>

<h3>Methodology</h3>
<p>
    For each of the 167 SPARC galaxies with valid mass discrepancy radii, the residual from the $M^{1/3}$ prediction is calculated as:
    $$\text{Residual} = \log_{10}(R_{\rm DM} / R_{\rm pred})$$
    where $R_{\rm pred} = k \cdot M_{\rm bar}^{1/3}$ with $k = 7.86 \times 10^{-4}$ kpc/$M_\odot^{1/3}$. These residuals are then correlated with:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><em>Baryonic properties.</em> Gas fraction ($f_{\rm gas}$), surface brightness ($\Sigma$), and inclination, treated as proxies for feedback efficiency, star formation history, and observational systematics.</li>
    <li><em>Screening proxy.</em> Central density ($\rho_{\rm central}$), treated as a proxy for local screening strength independent of $R_{\rm DM}$.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>
    The residual correlations reveal a clear pattern:

<h3>Interpretation</h3>
<p>
    The maximum baryonic correlation is $|r| = 0.297$ (inclination), which likely reflects observational systematics in rotation curve deprojection rather than physical feedback. The gas fraction and surface brightness—the primary tracers of baryonic feedback efficiency—show weak correlations ($|r| < 0.2$) that are either marginally significant or non-significant.
</p>
<p>
    Critically, the central density (screening proxy) shows no significant correlation ($r = -0.108$, $p = 0.16$). <strong>The weak correlation with central surface density is consistent with</strong> (though does not by itself prove) a geometric origin: if baryonic feedback were the dominant driver of the scatter in this particular estimator, stronger covariance with surface brightness would be expected. The present results remain compatible with a substantial contribution from measurement uncertainty and geometric effects.
</p>

<div class="result-box">
    Summary: the residuals do not show strong correlations with gas fraction or surface brightness, while inclination shows a moderate correlation that is plausibly attributable to rotation-curve deprojection systematics. Central density does not show a statistically significant correlation in this analysis.

<h2>Scatter Quantification and Comparative Analysis</h2>

<p>
    The observed scatter of $\sigma = 0.48$ dex around the $M^{1/3}$ relation is substantial (corresponding to a factor of $\sim 3$ variation). Quantifying the origin of this scatter is essential for distinguishing the TEP signal from competing hypotheses.
</p>

<h3>Intrinsic vs. Measurement Scatter</h3>
<p>
    Standard error budgeting suggests that a significant fraction of this scatter is observational. Distance uncertainties in the SPARC sample typically range from 10–20%, which propagate to a ~0.1–0.2 dex uncertainty in $R_{\rm DM}$. Inclination corrections and non-circular motions contribute additional noise. However, the residual scatter ($\sim 0.3$ dex) likely reflects intrinsic variation in the galaxy population.
</p>

<h3>Comparison with MOND and LCDM+Feedback</h3>
<p>
    <strong>MOND:</strong> The Modified Newtonian Dynamics framework typically yields a tighter scatter ($\sim 0.13$ dex) in the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR). This is expected because MOND modifies gravity based on instantaneous local acceleration, a continuous variable. In contrast, this analysis extracts a single discrete parameter ($R_{\rm DM}$) from each rotation curve, a method inherently more sensitive to local irregularities and noise than the integrated RAR analysis. The larger scatter in $R_{\rm DM}$ does not invalidate the mean scaling; rather, it indicates that the "onset radius" is a noisy estimator of the underlying screening transition.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>LCDM + Feedback (Null Hypothesis):</strong> The standard cosmological model relies on baryonic feedback to explain rotation curve diversity. In this scenario, the "dark matter onset" is not a fundamental scale but an emergent property of halo assembly and feedback history. Hydrodynamic simulations (e.g., NIHAO, FIRE) typically predict a scaling of $R_{\rm DM} \propto M^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha \approx 0.3$–$0.4$, broadly consistent with observation. However, they struggle to explain why the normalization aligns with the specific density $\rho_c \approx 20$ g/cm³ derived from atomic and terrestrial constraints. The "Null Hypothesis" (that the $M^{1/3}$ scaling is a feedback coincidence) fails to explain the cross-scale convergence with GNSS and magnetar physics.
</p>

<div class="result-box">
    <h4>Why the TEP Model is Preferred</h4>
    <p>
        While MOND provides a tighter fit to galaxy kinematics alone, it offers no explanation for the GNSS clock correlations ($L_c \approx 4200$ km) or the magnetar anti-glitch scale. LCDM+Feedback can accommodate the galaxy scaling but treats the normalization as a free parameter, offering no predictive link to other scales. TEP is distinctive in that it links the normalization of the galactic relation ($k \approx 7.9 \times 10^{-4}$ kpc/$M_\odot^{1/3}$) to an external calibration, enabling a cross-scale consistency check without galaxy-by-galaxy tuning, within the stated systematic uncertainty.

<h3>Methodological Details</h3>
<p>
    The "onset radius" $R_{\rm DM}$ is defined as the <em>first radial bin</em> where $V_{\rm obs}/V_{\rm bar} > 1.3$ (fiducial threshold). Specifically:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>For each galaxy, the rotation curve is evaluated at the native SPARC radial sampling (not interpolated).</li>
    <li>The velocity ratio $V_{\rm obs}/V_{\rm bar}$ is computed at each radius.</li>
    <li>$R_{\rm DM}$ is the radius of the first bin exceeding the threshold.</li>
    <li>Galaxies with non-monotonic or noisy $V_{\rm obs}/V_{\rm bar}$ profiles are retained; the "first crossing" definition is robust to subsequent fluctuations.</li>
    <li>Galaxies that never exceed the threshold (8 of 175) are excluded from the fit.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    Bootstrap uncertainties (1000 resamples) account for sample variance. The threshold-marginalized estimate averages over loose (1.1), fiducial (1.3), and strict (1.5) definitions.
