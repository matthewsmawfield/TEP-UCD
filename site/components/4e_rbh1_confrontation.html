    <h2>3e. Direct Confrontation with RBH-1 Data</h2>
    
    <p>The preceding VLBI test applies to nearby resolvable objects. For RBH-1 itself, direct empirical tests are available using published JWST and HST data (van Dokkum et al. 2025). Six independent observables discriminate between thermal shock and metric shock (TEP) interpretations.</p>

    <h3>The Line Width Test</h3>

    <p>
        In a thermal shock, the velocity discontinuity implies post-shock heating to $T \sim 10^7$ K, which broadens spectral lines via thermal Doppler motion. The expected thermal velocity dispersion for oxygen ions at this temperature is $\sigma_{\text{th}} \approx 80\text{--}85$ km/s. In contrast, a metric shock produces a coherent redshift gradient without thermalization; the gas remains cold, and line widths stay narrow (see Figure 9).
    </p>

    <p>
        JWST/NIRSpec and Keck/LRIS spectroscopy of the [O III] λ5007 emission at the bow shock apex yields (van Dokkum et al. 2025, Appendix C):
    </p>

    <div class="equation">$$\sigma_{\text{obs}} = 31 \pm 4 \text{ km/s}$$</div>

    <p>This observed dispersion is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>3× smaller than expected for gas that reached $T \sim 10^7$ K</li>
        <li>10× larger than pure thermal broadening at $T \sim 10^4$ K ($\sigma_{\text{th}} \approx 2\text{--}3$ km/s)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The authors attribute the excess dispersion to "turbulence" and "velocity gradient across the bow shock limbs." However, the critical point is that the gas is observationally cold ($T \sim 10^4$ K), not hot. Combined with the cooling time analysis (Section 1), which demonstrates $t_{\text{cool}}/t_{\text{dyn}} \approx 20$, the narrow line width places strong constraints on scenarios in which a dominant $\sim 10^7$ K phase persists and then cools promptly.
    </p>

    <div class="finding">
    <p>The observed line width is in strong tension with a simple single-phase thermal shock interpretation and is more naturally accommodated by a coherent redshift-gradient (metric-shock) hypothesis.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>The Wake Collimation Test</h3>

    <p>
        Thermal shocks generate turbulence via Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities at the shear layer between the wake and the ambient medium. Over the 73 Myr lifetime of the RBH-1 wake, such instabilities should broaden the wake substantially. The characteristic K-H growth timescale is $\tau_{\text{KH}} \sim \lambda / v_{\text{shear}} \approx 3$ Myr for $\lambda \sim 1$ kpc and $v_{\text{shear}} \sim 300$ km/s. Over 73 Myr, this corresponds to ~22 e-folding times—the wake should be completely disrupted (see Figure 10).
    </p>

    <p>
        Instead, HST WFC3/UVIS imaging reveals (van Dokkum et al. 2025, Section 6.2.1):
    </p>

    <div class="equation">$$R_{\text{wake}} \approx 0.7 \text{ kpc} \quad \text{over} \quad L_{\text{wake}} = 62 \text{ kpc} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{Aspect Ratio: } 90:1$$</div>

    <p>
        This is described by the authors as "strikingly narrow." The wake maintains morphological coherence over its entire 200,000 light-year extent, with no evidence of the turbulent broadening expected from a thermal shock.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the metric shock interpretation, no thermalization occurs, and therefore no Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities develop. The wake remains collimated because the velocity gradient is a coherent redshift boundary, not a turbulent shear layer.
    </p>

    <div class="finding">
    <p>The extreme collimation (90:1 aspect ratio) is difficult to reconcile with generic turbulent-wake expectations and is qualitatively consistent with a more laminar, non-thermal driver.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>The Stellar Age Gradient Test</h3>

    <p>
        In a thermal shock, star formation is delayed by the cooling time ($t_{\text{cool}} \approx 36$ Myr). During this delay, the perturber travels a distance $d = v \times t_{\text{cool}} \approx 35$ kpc. This creates a "star formation delay zone" where no young stars should exist (see Figure 11).
    </p>

    <p>
        Paper I reports that stellar continuum colors are "well-fit by a simple model that has a monotonically increasing age with distance from the tip" (van Dokkum et al. 2023). The youngest stars are at the tip, not 35 kpc behind it.
    </p>

    <div class="finding">
    <p>The observed age gradient qualitatively disfavors a long cooling-delay zone; quantitative model comparison requires a fully specified stellar-population fitting procedure and error model.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>The Preshock Temperature Anomaly</h3>

    <p>
        The Mappings V shock models used to fit the emission line ratios require a preshock temperature of $T_{\text{pre}} \sim 10^{5.6}$ K (van Dokkum et al. 2025, Section 5.2). This is 40× higher than standard CGM conditions ($T_{\text{CGM}} \sim 10^4$ K) (see Figure 12).
    </p>

    <p>
        In the TEP framework, the "preshock ionization" has a natural explanation: the soliton boundary creates a steep gravitational redshift gradient that produces an effective ionizing radiation field. The ionization is metric-induced, not thermal.
    </p>

    <div class="finding">
    <p>Within the TEP framing, a metric-induced contribution could reduce reliance on anomalously high preshock temperatures, but this mapping requires a forward model from field profile to ionization diagnostics.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>The Star Formation Efficiency Problem</h3>

    <p>
        The thermal shock model faces a mass budget problem (van Dokkum et al. 2025, Section 6.2.2). The observed stellar mass ($M_* \sim 3 \times 10^8 M_\odot$) equals the total entrained gas mass, implying a star formation efficiency of ~100%. The maximum realistic efficiency is ~30% (see Figure 13).
    </p>

    <p>
        In the metric shock model, heating is not the primary driver; instead, the apparent discontinuity is interpreted as a coherent redshift gradient. In such a picture, cold gas can collapse more efficiently because thermal pressure support is reduced. A realistic SFE of ~30% would then be more easily accommodated without invoking a non-standard IMF.
    </p>

    <div class="finding">
    <p>The metric-shock hypothesis offers a possible route to reducing the star-formation-efficiency tension by avoiding a prolonged hot phase; a decisive assessment still depends on the inferred gas mass and its systematics.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Alternative Explanations Under the Thermal Shock Model</h4>
    <p>For completeness, several mechanisms have been proposed to reconcile thermal shocks with cold, star-forming wakes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Turbulent Mixing Layers:</strong> Shear-driven entrainment of cold ambient gas into the hot wake (e.g., Gronke &amp; Oh 2018). However, this typically produces multiphase structure with broad line wings, not the narrow, single-component profiles observed.</li>
        <li><strong>Magnetic Draping:</strong> Ordered magnetic fields can suppress Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities and maintain wake coherence. This could explain the 90:1 aspect ratio but does not address the cold line widths or immediate star formation.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-Equilibrium Ionization:</strong> Rapid cooling through the $10^5$–$10^6$ K range can produce anomalous ionization states. This may explain the preshock temperature anomaly but requires fine-tuning of the cooling trajectory.</li>
        <li><strong>Beam Smearing:</strong> Instrumental resolution effects could artificially narrow observed line widths. However, the JWST/NIRSpec spectral resolution ($R \sim 2700$) corresponds to $\sigma_{\rm inst} \approx 50$ km/s, which would broaden rather than narrow the observed $\sigma = 31$ km/s.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>None of these mechanisms individually resolves all six anomalies simultaneously. The metric shock interpretation offers a unified explanation but requires accepting the TEP framework.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="principle">
    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>Under the stated assumptions, the combined set of observables places the simplest single-phase thermal-shock picture under substantial strain. Thermal-shock explanations may still be viable with additional physics (multiphase structure, mixing, magnetic draping, non-equilibrium ionization) and improved forward modeling. More decisive discrimination awaits deeper spectroscopy and spatially resolved temperature mapping.</p>
